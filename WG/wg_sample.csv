"Interesting, and a very good question. I believe the importance of targeting racism in particular for me *personally* is something which have arisen from two things, which are travelling and having a very diverse circle of friends (*one thing leading to another of course, as an example I met one of the two co-founders of this initiative in a hostel in Cusco, Peru. I was also introduced to my girlfriend by a guy I met in Tokyo back in 2016).*   
In terms of travelling, I think my time spent in South America and particular staying/living up in a favela in Rio de Janeiro was one of my favorite experiences which was an eye-opener to me (happy to share a longer story and go deeper into it, but it‚Äôs TL;DR for here ‚Äì Hit me up on Discord if you‚Äôd want to hear more, Haxwell#0824). 

In terms of friends to provide you a short and less complex &amp; understandable example (or two): I‚Äôve got a good friend of mine here in Sweden who‚Äôs got family from Trinidad &amp; Tobago. Understanding how different our lives are and have been even if we live in the same city, only because I‚Äôm a white guy and she‚Äôs a brown girl, have made racism in particular important for me to tackle.   
Also, having a girlfriend who's been a victim of targeted racism on the streets of London (she's Asian) have made me interested in pursuing solutions dealing with racism in the fields where I can actually do something impactful.  

In terms of gaming, the short answer to that is because of the problematic behavior between people in Dota2 as that‚Äôs a game I enjoy playing with some of my friends now that we cannot meet due to COVID-19.   
As for osu! I haven‚Äôt experienced any racism of my own when playing osu! and I‚Äôm happy to say that most people have been very nice having to do with during my entire osu! career (even though I didn‚Äôt know the game had a chat feature for the first year of playing).","NO"

"Hello Exotics_tech, and thank you for your submission to Gaming PC! If you are new please check out our rules over at the wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamingpc/wiki/rules)!
We have recently added the useful feature of Title Flair! You can set this manually by clicking Flair under your post once you have submitted your post, but if you missed it in the rules there is a much better way that will automatically flair your post!   

To do this simply add what your post is about in brackets before your title. For example for a Build Log you can type [Build Log] before your post so that it looks like this; [Build Log]My new awesome build!, and the bot will automatically set your flair to Build Log! This works for Build Log, Build Showcase, News, Hardware News, Hardware Release, Discussion, and Miscellaneous!

Also remember that this is a place for discussing and sharing our love of Gaming Computers! This is NOT the place for help building or determining what parts you should buy, that is better suited for /r/buildapc.  Troubleshooting questions should be directed to /r/techsupport. Thank you again!

Just checked. Manhattan only has ~1.6 mill resident population and 22.96  sq miles. So it has around 70k people per saw mile, which already beats every city in the world except the top two. Then, add in the fact that on an average workday, Manhattan's population goes up to 4 mill from commuters and tourists. That puts the density at 174k per sq mile, which is higher than any city in the word by 70k. I'd warrant the amount would be even more stark if you just looked at midtown/downtown.

"About jungle paths; just start with the krugs/gromp at botlane and smite it directly and have your teammates help you with it. Afterwards take the big buff (blue/red). 

This basically works for any jungler and what you do afterwards is up to you and depends on the champion. Some champions get hurt quite badly in the jungle and have to base after 3 camps, so you can either take a small camp or make a long distance walk for your big buff (prob not worth it). Others can do a full clear and just do all the camps.

Runes are essential; since the jungle hurts early game, you need a decent amount of armor and preferably AS reds for most AD junglers, or some magic pen reds for AP junglers.

Most important is to keep following what goes on in your lanes and find places where you can get succesfull ganks off. When the game loads look at all 3 matchups top/mid/bot and which lanes you can or can't gank easily. You can use F1/F2/F3/F4/F5 to quickly switch camera to one of your allies and watch their lane to see how it goes.

Focus more on winning (/even) lanes than losing lanes, your winning lanes have the damage to easily pick up kills and can snowball faster. Losing lanes ganks often fail and can even result in multiple deaths for your team.","NO"

"I don't work with academia directly, so i can't say the exact kinds of requests that might be made of a professor. The requests that we get are generally more related to personnel matters. Things like hire date, name, paygrade, performance history, and salary are all public information and can be requested by anyone at any time. I believe at least one local newspaper requests the salary data every year and posts it online.

The other requests we get are usually because someone is getting sued, and we need to create a full history of their digital lives over the time period requested. Usually these are specific, as in all communications dealing with project X or person Y, but not always. But chances are, if you or your department are getting sued, a FOIA request has been made at approximately the same time. In this situation we actually go back and create a full synthetic copy of your life over the time period requested. All of your emails, documents, IMs, calendar items, and contacts are recreated into a full digital set, and then sent to legal for delivery.

The other kind of request we get is similar, where there is some sort of scandal and the newspapers/tv stations make requests. There isn't necessarily a lawsuit(yet), but you always know about these requests when you see/hear ""in documents obtained by"".

"I totally agree. When it comes down to it, a measure of time is the most realistic cost. Its just very hard/impossible to use since different activities have different reward rates.

My point is just that people seem to say ""x is sooo expensive. It costs y gold and they nerfed liquid gold"". Which is silly. The (arbitrary) number is so high because of liquid gold. Because it was a reliable farm for a reliably desired resource. The market is flooded with gold so it's not worth as much.

If gold isn't a valuable resource then stop farming it. Especially if they nerf the farm spot. It would be more accurate to compare the cost of armor to another stable material but part of the reason ascended is so expensive is because of the market being all over the place right now.

I'm not against ascended stuff being cheaper. Even before the market shift it cost way too many hours of dungeon or sw farming to get a full set for my tastes.

Maybe I'm just arguing semantics but I just keep reading those posts as ""this thing that I want takes too much farming of my over farmed resource."" This happens in game economics. You usually have to keep switching up your farm based on market desire. Market desire for gold is down right now. Flax was high. Now it's trending down pretty hard too.

"[New research shows that laser spectral linewidth is classical-physics phenomenon](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-07/uos-nrs071020.php)
*In [the new study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079672720300094), the researchers find that a fundamental principle of lasers, that the amplification of light compensates for the losses of the laser, is only an approximation. The team quantify and explain that a tiny excess loss, which is not balanced by the amplified light but by normal luminescence inside the laser, provides the answer to the spectral linewidth of the laser.*

The broadening of spectral lines into bands is easily observable with discharge tubes filled with gas under increasing pressure: as the atom collisions gets increasingly packed, they involve rising number of parasitic energy levels and they tend to wash-out their spectral lines by converging into Planck radiation law. Whereas spectral lines are pronouncedly quantum effect by itself, their broadening is thus indicia that energy transfer becomes increasingly multiparticle, collectivist and classical.

The way this study changes our understanding of lasers by its authors is that what was previously thought the broadening of line was quantum-mechanical limitation on lasers  limiting how close to being monochromatic they can be  turns out to not be a result of fundamental quantum uncertainty. 

But I'd wouldn't be so sure about it in this very case, because more frequently colliding atoms also pose stress to localization of particles (they simply have less space for their wiggling between collisions), so that their momentum and energy levels would get more relaxed just according to uncertainty principle. From this perspective the convergence of quantum theory to classic physics within multiparticle systems is just another way how to apply uncertainty principle at microscopic level and even the successful application of semi-classical [Schawlow-Townes equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_linewidth) for line width of lasers can change nothing very much about it. 

In its own way this study could also illustrate  the contemporary attitude of progressivist physics for ""dumbed down"" phenomenological description of physical phenomena which is not relying on fundamental physical theories so much.","NO"

"From Vancouver, I'm familiar with Toronto. It's actually pretty similar to Vancouver, obviously bigger, everything is cheaper. Good night life. I didn't mind the snow, cold is a bit bothersome from time to time, wardrobe reload to have stuff you can wear, be warm in and look good in for sure. 

The subway is more comprehensive than the Skytrain, getting around is easier. Driving outside of the city is far worse, believe it or not, but you won't have to deal with that. 

I mean, it's a city. It's a very American city by Canadian standards in so much as its size and it could be any number of cities. That sounds like a bad things, but I love cities, and it's a good one. I don't mean it as a slight. My absolute favorite thing about it, wasn't so much it, it was location. You are very close to Ottawa, Montreal, Chicago, NY (detroi yuck). Close enough for weekend trips easily. There is nothing like that on the coast. 

The nightlife there is generally awesome. Having everything cheaper all the time was very fun. I'd say go for it. Any time I personally end up living in a city that's cold I really dislike it. Truth be told though, it's just super annoying for doing things like running, I'm used to running year round, outdoors, in vancouver.

"The coin creates two positive feedbackloops which drives the price upward making it a good stable store of value

The rate of inflation is 1% and the very well made and high paying multipool is feeding more than 1% into the system. It is a proof of stake coin where miners mine other PoW coins and buy BC. 

Unlike other PoW coins where miners dump new coins into the market, miners hold and gain value. This creates a system where there is constant buying pressure. 

When the price goes up, more miners join, causing the buying pressure to increase. This causes the price to go up more. Its a feedback loop.

"Rodgers - I think he is back to being the best. He definitely had some issues for awhile and I'll leave it up to you to decide what they were but since about week 6 or 7 he has looked amazing again. Not an overall MVP year due to the start but he is back to having a great completion % and is showing his usual running threat every game. Oh and he is easily young enough to still play more than enough great seasons for me to justify this.

Wilson - The biggest doublt threat in the game. I don't think there is anyone who is as much of a threat to take off and escape as him that is also as good a passer as he is

Mariota - Looks to have a very bright future. Very accurate and few mistakes.

Luck - Carries his team almost every year so far

"My father  didn't believe women should know how to drive so he said he would never teach me. One day out of the blue, I was very sick (I had the flu and a cold sore outbreak on my face, I looked horrific) and home for the day from school. He said, if you want to learn to drive, you can go take the temp test today or choose to go to the doctor.  

I was 16, so I chose to take the test because it was my only opportunity. I never had the booklet (this was before it was even online) and I had like 2 minutes of leafing through it before taking the 15 question quiz or whatever. I started having a terrible fever, wanting vomit, and couldn't think so I ended up failing the test (a lot of the questions weren't even about driving, they were about the DUI jail and fine lengths.) He said I fucked my one chance. Thanks  I developed extreme anxiety and aversion to driving. I also really struggled finding work because bus lines are very limiting.

I finally learned to drive about a decade after graduating high school, thanks to my boyfriend (who I am still with) and he is (lightly put) obsessed with cars.( I never had access to a car or anyone with insurance that would cover a learner's permit adult that you aren't related to.) Thankfully, he helped me buy a car, a tiny Fiat 500, that is technically in his name (since you can't actually buy a car without a license) and he taught me to drive in it. I'm terrified of driving large cars and I don't care for driving on highways due to my anxiety, but I'm getting better. I'm a cautious driver and I've had at least some better work opportunities thanks to having access to transit. 

I'm sorry your mom had to feel put down and felt that she couldn't learn to drive. It took me a long time to be able to do it and when I was 25, I was still being ridiculed by people for not being able to which only contributed to my hindrance.","NO"

I wear diapers. It is fun. I have friends who also wear diapers. We do things like drink expensive beer, drive dune buggies on the beach, and watch stupid cartoons. I have other friends who I race cars with. I even have a few friends who I only like in small doses but mean the world to me when they just come over to talk. I am my own boss, I make less money than Id like but I spend my days driving tractors, making art and drinking wine. I do things that make me happy, including being very independent.

What do you do exactly? Write code for a big company? Is that fun? Do you get to wear whatever you want or do you obsess over the whiteness of your teeth. Do you like living with your parents? What happens when you want to take a girl friend (or guy, whatever) home? Or do you work so much that you dont have time for relationships? Do you do anything other than be a code monkey?

You seem to think that a bunch of people will rally on your side and condemn the weird diaper wearing freak, but, look around. Your an angry child lashing out and no one is buying it.

Take a step back, look at your life. You think cutting benifits of others so you can have.. What, 1.5k is about a week of profit for you right?

"yes flirting can very much be unintentional. i dont see anything wrong with the actions her friends say she did. there is nothing wrong with her dancing however she wants infront of whomever, and nothing wrong with sitting between the guys (doesnt matter if there was room or not). do people somehow think that once someone is in a relationship then they should be put in a cage and not do anything fun? it sounds to me that her friends were jealous of her outgoing nature which probably (unintentionally) gets her more attention. theres nothing wrong with wanting to feel wanted, but i doubt that was her intention at all. her friends sound very insecure and kind of mysoginistic. despite how drunk she was, she still didn‚Äôt cross any boundaries or kiss anyone and she made it clear that she had a boyfriend. should she make herself smaller just because she is in a relationship? she seems to have a very attractive personality, should she change that just because her friends think its inappropriate? attractive personalities will get positive attention, and if she didnt cheat then i dont see the problem with getting attention and liking it too! it seems to me that her friends are sexualizing friendliness a bit too much. tbh you sound controlling and insecure. you got into a relationship with someone who has an attractive personality and now you want her to change that personality to accommodate you and her jealous friends lol","YES"

"I think there are two more concerns that matter to me more than ""how many"" of a given stablecoin (let's call it STABLEC) are in existence at any one time. I guess I take it for granted that you can see this info with the blckchain.

**Concern 1:  Do I trust the issuing entity?**

I want to know that if 1million STABLEC are issued, there is actually $1M USD in a box somewhere. I want a third party, not the company, to have third party verification that there is money in the vault. I don't want to end up in a situation like that dude from Game of Thrones. You open the vault and find nothing inside.

After all, its not like a company mints 1 million STABLEC, collects together $1M USD and never creates another STABLEC ever again. The money goes somewhere (investments) and every single one of these stablecoin issuers has a mechanism to create more coins as demand increases.

Now banks already loan out more than they have in reserves. However, there's regulation and insurance for most users backed by the US Govt. None of these stablecoin issuers have this mechanism.

When I last looked at it, the only stablecoin I found which had external auditing was Gemini's GUSD. If USDT, USDC, USDS, etc have nothing to hide, why aren't they getting proper audits?

**Concern #2: Do I trust a custodian to pay me the interest promised?**

\- I've considered using GUSD but for me personally, I haven't found a usecase for my needs just yet (the yields I've found with custodians I trust don't pay enough for me to merit locking up the cash).

[https://www.gemini.com/dollar](https://www.gemini.com/dollar)

\- FWIW,  I trusted Blockfi, they used to allow GUSD deposits to earn up to 7% APY on up to 20K worth of GUSD, but they no longer allow deposits from US customers.  

\- I'm more skeptical about DEFI; I cannot audit the smart contracts myself so I'm not 100% sure I believe that some of these DEFI/Stablecoin mechanisms are anything more than a ponzi scheme like UST/Luna (you get in, hope you make something, and get out before the music stops).

Bottom Line: For me, I'm not 100% sure 7% APY is worth it to trust both the custodian and the underlying coin when I have other investments in the real world  that has been reliably paying me 10% for the last 4+ years.","NO"

I guess that's the only reason I'm not commissioner. 

2) I also don't care THAT much about the lack of personality in the league's players. I like when guys like PK, Marchand, or Matthews show a bit of swagger but I don't mind that the majority of players come across as a bit dull. 

I would *much* rather have the players be predictable and boring than the soap opera that is the NBA or soccer, to an extent. Surely there's a happy medium between the players being robots and players being divas (Irving saga, for example).","NO"

Beyond that revolution comes from the strain people feel materially, Biden is but a bandaid for the larger issue, giving only the minor improvements that temporarily stave off the Lefts growth. Beyond that, remember after the left shackled themselves to Obama in 2008 and then watched him oppose our interests at occupy, Ferguson and Baltimore it was the right that got the majority of the growth. Electing the center right bandaid only goes I think to stoke the fires of rising right wing sentiments. Plus god knows Biden‚Äôs foreign policy might have the possibility of being worse than Trumps. Think about how Trump at least is too dumb to actually get focused on any of his international targets for too long. Look at Iran and Venezuela for that. Biden will likely be a return to the Obama era of silent war crimes. This is not to say that Biden will be worse than Trump, I think Biden would be less bad overall, but I can‚Äôt personally feel okay signing on to those other issues.

"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

About a year and a half ago, I started a new job. I met a friend named A on day 1, and B trained me. I became pretty good friends with A very quickly, and soon became friends with B. A and B start dating 2 weeks later.

During the course of the relationship, I noticed a few signals here and there from B. At this point I‚Äôve never dated, so I didn‚Äôt know how to interpret the situations thrown at me, so I didn‚Äôt think much of what was happening. B would invite me to movies and such, while it was upsetting A that I came with them.

After they dated for about 6 months, the relationship between them ended. It ended because A crossed a huge (and illegal) line, and didn‚Äôt realize what he had done wrong. This is about the time he becomes less of a friend to me.

A couple of **DAYS** later, we all 3 get invited to a work party. B gets super drunk. A had said that he wasn‚Äôt coming, because B and I were there. He ended up coming anyway. I comfort B while A is there because B didn‚Äôt to see him. B and I go to a different part of the house and B holds my hand and drunkenly admits that she likes me.

Having 0 idea how to process this, I talk to A on the way home from the party and he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think she means it like that‚Äù.

Well, she meant it like that.

We ended up having a little thing for a few weeks on and off but we mutually ended it. I never told A, though he almost 100% knows because our work group was a gossip heaven.

I really don‚Äôt like that it ended up this way, but I always think about it. AITA?

"&gt; is small enough, new users should be able to learn what will get them banned without inadvertently transgressing.

agreed. But even then, we weren't allowed to challenge the rules to include banning. 

&gt; a political sub should especially be clear about whether they allow dissenting opinions, or only comments that ascribe to whatever liberal or anarchist values the creators and moderators decide. i think it's rather despicable to enforce a political agenda by harsher removal of dissenting comments than comments you agree with, without publicly acknowledging that is what is being done. 

We didn't decide to ban people for dissenting opinions. None of us. Some mods including me decided to remove inflammatory posts of people posting inflammatory posts over time. 

Sure, you might argue, that these posts annoy us and a few people because we don't like the opinions of them. But what about the nature of the comment (think: presentation). Imagine posting :

&gt; ""Free speech is the BEST THING EVER. All you people need to stop dwelling in your parent's basements and see the world for what it is!""

What do you think of this for a rules lite RPG combat?

to hit roll 1d20+1dX where X is your combat ability die (1d4 thru 1d12)

for damage you use the same 1dX roll that added to your hit.

Your combat abilities are represented by a die that applies to your to-hit AND is your damage.

I think it will speed up combat rolls by removing static modifiers (+1 +2) and makes character creation and tracking easier for beginners

"The yellow one is a pig, right? So what kind is he?

The yellow one very helpfully told us in the intro to episode 2 so there's really no debating that (and the pig squealing at the end of episode 4). But pigs are pinky-fleshy coloured and don't have stylish, mullet-y mohawk things like yellow man and our chosen pig species. So, I looked through all of the available wikipedia pages of all of the members of the Suidae family (pigs) and I believe I have found the best match. \*drumroll please\* THE PYGMY HOG

[pygmy hog \(Porcula salvania\) Image credit: A. J. T. Johnsingh, WWF-India and NCF](https://preview.redd.it/q6york51jdw91.jpg?width=4608&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=074f896aae47ba577f319def0df6550bf9a8769e)

I believe that this member of the pig family is closest in physical appearance to yellow man. Why? Well this pig species has a blueish-blackish cape of fur on its head which resembles hair. And its fur is probably the closest to a yellowish colour in the whole extant pig family. As well as having a rounded ear which looks like a human ear. So physical appearance-wise, good.

"when I realized they really did lack empathy (dog had mishaps, I am the asshole. kind of long)

In the early fall last year, my dog snuck out of the car when my neighbor and I took him for a ride and we lost track of him for half an hour. I called my mom since she was up the street. My mom has this SIGH when she disapproves of anything and that was the primary thing I was getting out of her and I was not having that shit, since she was totally comfortable kicking me out of the car or leaving me at the park to have a panic attack when I was little and then coming back because of ""motherly guilt""...somehow, I just don't think she actually experiences such a thing. I went ahead and yelled at her. (And then apologized later even though I didn't mean it, because who wants that fallout?) We found him unscathed the next town over and I was so happy I quit smoking within the week.

A few weeks later, which was the most terrifying incident, my dog managed to get hold of a...*special* brownie. I had to get a lift to the vet in the middle of the night (I don't drive, another story for another day because it is very much N-related) because he'd started having tremors and wasn't going to get through the night without medical intervention.

I dropped him off, vet said his heart rate was still good, assured me that I am in fact *not* a terrible piece of shit for accidentally (because naturally I had eaten one too) dropping special brownies on the floor where my dog could get into them and told me he'd call me if either 1. things took a turn for the worse or 2. my doggy was ready to come home. Went home, stayed up all night staring at my phone. I think I managed to sleep for maybe 3 hours because I woke up at 10am and was kicking myself because ""omgomg what if I missed a call from the vet that my dog was dying and I didn't get to say goodbye and he was all alone I AM THE WORST"" etc. I did not, thankfully. In fact I called the vet to ask for an update, and was told that he got charcoal and was still having tremors, but they were decreasing and he was drinking water again.

First words out of my mom's mouth to me that morning were ""this WHOLE thing could have been prevented, you know."" Which is true, yeah? But it was about 12 hours too late for that. Obviously, that bitchy comment wasn't enough because my dad got involved with zero provocation. I was berated for causing my dog's medical emergency (I am not allowed to do anything by accident), told I was an incompetent pet owner/parent (really? my dog's not the one who freezes in fear every time someone looks at them--nmom's dog IS.), was told I had to quit my job because I was OBVIOUSLY too irresponsible to have one, and just generally got the irresponsible/stupid/etc. speech. From the way they were talking you'd think I force-fed my dog an entire batch of brownies laced with cyanide for shiggles. They also kept going on and on about how OMGEXPENSIVE emergency vet visits are which made me paranoid that this visit was going to be, like, thousands of dollars or something.

My dog was cleared to come home around dinnertime that night. They suddenly started acting civil, but I was still required to quit my job or put up with them constantly being on my ass about that. (Which made me the bad guy for a while with my employer, who is also my neighbor/friend. :/ ) I completely gave up what little illicit shit I was doing, and almost entirely stopped eating chocolate at home out of paranoia. The vet bill came and it was a measly $250 which I pretty much immediately paid, and I figured the whole thing was taken care of and I could kind of deal with being treated like shit since it all ended well. (Plus I just kind of wanted to snuggle my dog in peace.)

Of course later when my dog got hold of a chicken bone and managed to eat the whole thing before I could get it away from him, even though I got him an x-ray (where the vet once again told me I was handling it correctly) and PAID FOR IT, I was the asshole all over again and my dad told me to ""knock it off"" as if I planned all these things like some Munchausen by proxy shit. I don't THRIVE on these accidents. If I did, I'd never take any preventative measures like making major changes to my lifestyle and watching my dog like a hawk or locking him out of the room if I'm eating ANYTHING that might be hazardous.

If something terrible happened to my siblings I'm sure my mother would expect endless amounts of pity--and by Jove she'd get it. But if something happens to my dog, who I take better care of than I was ever given as a child, I'm an incompetent sociopath who can't be trusted to take care of a goldfish.

Incidentally, when my goldfish died, I sobbed hysterically for hours because I didn't want it to suffer.","NO"

There's this article about gender that I read the other day, and it touched me so so deeply, but I didn't save it, and I couldn't find it again. It would really be amazing to my mental health to have it to look at again instead of just the memory.

I don't have too much information other than the content of the article. It was named something roughly like ""Why I chose to never come out of the closet as a trans woman."" And it details this year by year story of her life as a closeted trans woman, and it also talked a lot about her struggle of feeling rejected by the women of queer communities, especially when they made ""men are bad"" jokes","NO"

"New medium energy weapon

Remeber that weapon in the test server a while back, the one that shot the red floating ball and did some damage on impact, ya that one. Well the game does need some new medium weapons and I think this would be a good idea.

So it shoots a plasma sphere which travels at a speed of 80 km a second. It will detonate when at a 20 kilometer proximity to any enemy and pull them plus any other enemies in the radius towards the center of detonation, (think [Orisa's halt ability](https://youtu.be/vXCCYz1j0v8) from Overwatch)dealing 10,000 damage, know you may be thinking this is kind of week but for every extra robot it pulls in the explosion will deal 2,500 extra damage. 

Reload- 16 seconds
Cost- 1250 Au or 5,500 workshop points
Looks- like a hydra but with one barrel instead of six
Range- 250 effective, 350 max range (stalkers will be able to evade your shots and you will have to lead your shots). 

This would be useful for crowd control, stalling enemies from getting away, and pulling snipers out of their camping spots. 

Drawbacks- you will have to lead your shots and if you miss long reload penalty. Fast robots can dodge your projectile.

"I‚Äôm sensitive to spirits. How can I protect myself and learn more so I‚Äôm not so afraid?

It started coming around in my late teens and it does have an affect on my everyday. It makes me feel a little paranoid when a few of my experiences make me afraid to sleep in my room. I‚Äôve seen full body apparitions, heard voices, been touched, and nearly every day I get the sense I‚Äôm being watched at some point.

I understand that being a little sensitive might put me in danger. Knowledge is key in my opinion‚Äîand a lack thereof is often the source of fears‚Äîand I‚Äôm hoping speaking with you all and seeking some guidance might ease my worries and open me to some objects that might keep me safe or make me sleep easier at night.

"making LUKS encryption remote capable

so I have an ubuntu that's mostly set up using this guide (I didnt split root and home and I have EFI but that's basically it for the deviations):

[https://askubuntu.com/questions/918021/encrypted-custom-install](https://askubuntu.com/questions/918021/encrypted-custom-install)

but my main problem is that I cannot start the pc from remote as there's no way to either have it unlock by itself or enter the password remotely.

&amp;#x200B;

so my question is: is there a way to either

1. get a way to remotely unlock the machine (e.g. by having the preboot spin up an SSH server or whatever to let me enter the password)
2. unlock itself using TPM

&amp;#x200B;

or 3) even a combination of the 2 allowing for a simpler ""PIN"" approach and having an actual ""password"" only for recovery purposes that can be significantly longer as it would only need to be used in an emergency, but still being able to enter pin/password remotely.

"$200 for super bowl food

I'm usually not bothered by Howard and Robin's extreme wealth.  And I suppose they do a pretty good job of censoring elements of their lifestyles that would be unbelievable to the average American.  But I got very annoyed during the News today when they condescendingly laughed at the average Super Bowl consumer spending only $200 for food during the game.  ""What kind of food do you think you can you get for that ($200)?!"" asks Robin.  ""Pieces of bread,"" answers Howard as Robin disdainfully cackles like a drunk Marie Antoinette in the background.  ""I can't even iMAGine what you can eat for $200!""

Really?  If ten people are at a party you can't feed them for $200?  Are we getting take-out from Nobu and drinking vintage Bordeaux for a football game?  Never mind the fact that the report clearly stated that each individual will spend $200, which means the party of ten will bring together $2000.00.  But $2000.00 would still probably incite Robin's cackle and Howard's reproachful disbelief.  Ugh.","NO"

"i am moobeat, creator and contributor for the LoL fansite Surrender at 20. AMA!

Hello everybody. I'm **Moobeat**, I'm 29 years old, and I created and continue to produce daily content for Surrender at 20, a League of Legends news site focusing on PBE coverage, keeping a pulse on the latest news, and coalescing information into easy to digest collections.  I started Surrender at 20 stared back in February 2011 and, with a bit of luck and hard work, managed to grow up right along side the game and sprout into what it is today. Surrender at 20 is based out of my living room in Southern Indiana and it is the lone source of source of income for me and my fiancee.


Before we kick off, I'd like shine the spotline on the other folks who keep the WIPSHIP afloat. S@20's crew is very small. Every post on the site gets worked on by me and/or Aznbeat, with Frostyninja tagging in for the occasional assist and Uli looming in shadows.

Quick introductions for the crew:

-**Aznbeat** is my fiancee and she's been right by my side through this whole S@20 business - from cracking up at bugged PBE textures to stressing out over not being able to keep up with the news machine. While she's played less than a dozen ~actual~ games of League of Legends, lately Aznbeat has been doing a lot of heavy lifting on the site - even soloing the recent PBE cycle while I was out of commission - you may even have seen her on the daily PBE reddit shares trying to take in feedback, fix typos, and all that. She propped up our family when I wanted to take a chance see where the site could go and she's shouldered a ridiculous work schedule to keep it a float. Not hard to say S@20 wouldn't be here without her support and encouragement, through the trial and error of me being my own boss, countless missed social events, and even profanity at the sight of a late night unannounced PBE update.

-**FrostyNinja** handles the actual site, everything from the layout to backgrounds, etc. Here also tends to be stuck fixing whatever madness I unleash. I break a lot of things with the site. FrostyNinja makes sure I don't burn the whole damn site down with my .jpg names. Years ago when the site was super small, he sent me a rogue email volunteering to give the site a make over - I sense he was not impressed with my default purple blogger template. Even if he wasn't still here helping automate posts, bringing little jokes and easter eggs alive, or working the layout, his enthusiasm for my little blog snowballed S@20 into what it is and where it is today.

-**Uli** runs the SkinSpotlights channel and is the resident programmer and brain.  He's developed a lot of datamining and PBE tools, along with his own creator suite and various other projects.While his channel and S@20 are separate, we have mutually beneficial relationship despite Uli being British and the constant confusion about what a ""biscuit"" is.  Be it marking off the ""days since last pbe leak"" calendar or just tilting because the latest deploy mercilessly crippled all of the tools, Uli taught me how to PBE and I can't imagine how things would turn out if he never replied to my dopey youtube messages.

There are, of course, many other members of the S@20 family from over the years. Life moves fast, I'll always appreciate the effort they put into running projects from (our quite dated now) S@20 tournament, forging an esports section for the site, and wrangling in the comments.  I'd be a stooge to not also mention the S@20 community folks who contribute their time to helping us hunt down missing changes on twitter, keep things under control in our community discord, or simply shitpost the comment section.

It's been a few years since the last one but this is my second AMA here on the subreddit - a lot has changed since 2012! I'll be here for a few hours to answer questions on LoL, my job creating and maintaining an independent fan site, life, video games, concerns of the heart, and whatever else you might be interested in.

"Peavey invective MH or PRS mt15?

Hello, so ive been lately looking for a head amp thats around 600$ or cheaper, and i had many options, but those 2 amps catched my attention.
Im a metal player, so im looking for an amp that i can djent with, get brutal and heavy metal tones out of it without the need of overdrive pedals, and suitable for home use, thats why im going for low wattage.
The peavey invective seems to have many featurs built in it, which can let me play without plugging pedals in, and it also has the 1 watt option. Ideal for metal, so far i dont see cons about this amp.
The prs mt15 can only go down to 7 watts which isnt suitable for home use and it doesnt have as many features as the invective has.
So im really narrowed between these 2 as they have great tones from what ive heard on youtube, but i cant get the chance to hear them in real life so im asking owners of them for suggestions or recommendations for alternative amps.","NO"

"I've never been more afraid in my life

I was playing basketball tonight with friends and on the last game of the night I fucked up. 

The score was 14-13 to 15, eager to tie it up I drove baseline and popped an off balance floater. As I came down I landed on my left foot but my knee buckled. It popped. I instantly went down clutching my knee. 

The pop was heard from the peanut gallery. I play with medical students and they say it might be an Acl tear. I can't walk. I have to work tomorrow. I can't afford to pay medical bills. I make enough money to not qualify for financial assistance, but I pay most of my paychecks to my student loans. I have to pay for dental work unrelated. I'm scared. My girlfriend is asleep next to me and I'm wide awake. My mind is going a mile a minute. I'm so scared. I just want to curl up and scream and shout but I have no one to blame but myself. I can't sleep because of the pain. I have to work tomorrow. I can't take on the financial burden. I am so terrified right now.","NO"

"What to do with my Career considering Dyscalculia, Job Options and College?

OK, this will be a little long so bare with me.

I feel like I've hit a roadblock in life and don't know how to get over it. First off Let me explain, I have Dyscalculia and I just recently found out about it. For those of you not familiar with this disorder, it depends on the person, it varies, but generally, you cant do math properly, no fault of the teacher or tutor, its essentially your brain just can't get certain aspects of it down, ranging from the very basics, to time to advanced math etc. I was always a B and A student with occasional C's thrown in the mix. But I was always horrible at math. I sometimes lose place counting in my head and even have to use my fingers at times and I give pause even to addinging and subtracting, but i can do it, it just takes me a few extra seconds to process it at first. I start to struggle a bit with Decimals and Fractions unless I have a calculator to help. And Algebra or Geometry? Might as well tell me to try my chances at highway robbery, I'd have more of a shot at succeeding in that. I cannot get it. I can't absorb the formulas or understand how to solve the equations to save my life, if i do, its only for a brief moment then they leave my head. I only ever passed High School math (for my school it was basic algebra and geometry that were required) due to massive amounts of Homework in extra credit sections and tutoring, of which I failed the extra credit homework as well, but the teacher felt bad for me, so he passed me.

I graduated from HS years ago in 08 (27 now) and decided ""Hmmm, sure, Ill give college a try!"" I went part time for the next 4 years while working to pay for it at first then my parents chipped in latter on. I've done a number of odd jobs during that time, everything from Fast Food, to Waitressing, Retail for a number of years, and warehouse work. Went for a few years to Community, got great grades in everything except, you guessed it, math! Same Situation, had an understanding teacher ""Don't worry no one fails my class!"". He literally let me go and ask him almost every question on the tests and I did.

I had thought to go into teaching but I have bad anxiety speaking when its a room bigger than about a dozen, I almost fainted in college speech class when I got up in front of a room of about 30-something students. I thought briefly of pursuing Social Work but not long after that, my mom had a stroke, then cancer, shes still alive and made a phenomenal recovery tho on both accounts. I stopped going to college around that time and got fired from the warehouse job (only job I ever was fired from in case that's relevant).

So this is where the roadblock comes in. I had to move back home after my roommate and her boyfriend got a condo (a little after I was fired). I found a job, that was my first priority. Its working leather, its a nice environment, small business that's less than 15 people, great product and employees, nothing stressful most days either....but it pays crap (only 10$ an hour) and the boss is a man child. I've been there for almost 3 years in a few months and NEVER have gotten a raise, and some of the employees who were there longer, they stopped getting raises as well. Everytime we ask him it was ""oh well I can't because taxes are coming up"" *Comes in with a new boat, ""Oh I cant because we just got new equipment you guys needed to make the product quicker"" *Comes in with not 1 but 2 motorcycles....yeah you guys get this picture. Now hes going thru a divorce, went back to being an alcoholic and is neglecting getting us supplies at times, and his wife owns half the company...we all decided we might as well not even ask for a raise this year lol. to top it off we have been slow for 3,4 months now, its like Im essentially making minimum wage with paychecks.

Idk what to do, at all. I've been applying everywhere, for something on this level or better, I cant afford less than 10$ an hour its impossible to survive on that, I'm struggling like mad now with my current pay cuts, like if my car broke down, sure i have great credit but I don't think I could afford another, Id be screwed. I have applied at better quality retail like Aldi's and Costco due to having 3 years of experience and considered for Front End Supervisor at Sam's Club in the past, I would have to work my way back up but that's fine with me, but no one has gotten back to me. I applied at Walgreens as an assistant manager trainee, Really sold myself well in a video interview....no follow up. I looked into trades like Plumbing and Carpentry and...hey what do ya know? My old enemy, advanced math and formula's strikes back. I failed the 2 entry tests to get in. I tried getting a waitressing job again, no call backs from my local Olive Garden (I hated waitressing, so kind of a relief), I even applied to be a service tech to Spectrum and....yes, even a person who removes ""remnants"" at Crime Scenes since it doesnt require a degree (just finished that one today). At this point I'm starting to feel desperate and trapped, Unless the bosses wife gets the company, which who knows if she even is interested in it, then I'm screwed working here and I'm not going to sit on my bubbly butt to find out what happens with that! I'm now thinking of doing what my dad does and go for the post office, or even as a custodian as they make decent pay after a time if they are union. Garbage person too has crossed my mind... but beyond that, with no degree, my options seem to be narrowing down. Especially since Jobs don't seem to train but want someone with full experience.

Now, since my credits are still good, I was thinking of going back to college. I even took a few classes on and off the last few years to finish up my science aspects for my Associates. But idk what to do. I like helping people so I was thinking of getting a social working degree or looking into something with Technology that does not require in depth, advanced, calculations-does anything like that exist in the tech area? But Idk what to do about the Math, that seems to be my main obstacle in, well, getting out of being poor lol :( and I have a stupid disability in it along with ADHD, go figure. No matter how hard I try, i cant pass Algebra or Geometry on my own or with help. Idk if Colleges can wave math if they see Im going to follow a career that has no use for it, because I feel, unless I can substitute classes, thats my only option. Even then, there is another problem-my parents cant afford to send me to a 4 year college, my sister is in her program for physical therapy and that's A LOT of money for my parents, especially since my mom cant work long hours anymore. Taking out loans seems scary too, I already cant afford dirt, barely enough for my car payments and cell phone with anything left over and I've read the countless horror stories online of people with tens of thousands of dollars worth of debt and no one hiring you out of college, sometimes up to multiple years if you have no experience in the field. I can probly pay to finish community College at least but I need a better job...but I cant get a better job without math or someone calling back.

I feel like such a loser, having to move back in my mid-late 20's, no decent paying job, not having a totally clear idea of what to do, cant save up and cant afford much. Im just so beaten down and overwhelmed, I sometimes cry to myself, punch a wall, and even feel like just jumping off the bridge. Like, I hate this, it feels like its soooo difficult nowadays just to get by, or Im I just so broken down its just me and a few others at this point?
What would you guys suggest? College again? try for an outside job with little math skills and keep searching in that arena, highway robbery lol?

"How should I proceed?

Backstory: I've had a feeling that this girl was into me for a little while now. Every time I meet another one of her friends they typically say something along the lines of, ""Oh, I've heard so much about you."" The reason I haven't done acted on this in the past is because her and my roommate used to have a thing and this is the first time I've managed to go out with her alone. We are both in college.


Story: I went out to the bars/club with this girl and we were grinding and kissing at the club towards the end of the night. Later we went back to my place and drank a little more and ended up making out. She spent the night in my bed with her clothes on(including her scarf) because she was too drunk. After waking up, I found out she blacked out while we were out the night before, so I wasn't sure how to proceed. She did, however, take off her scarf and pants after she woke up and cuddled back up with me for a few hours. In hindsight, I should have done something in the morning, but we were both a bit hungover and I was doubting myself because she said she blacked out.


I was wondering how I should proceed and how I should greet her the next time I see her. Additionally, I can't see her for another 2-3 weeks due to spring break.","NO"

"I (28M) keep having crushes

Hi all
I (28M) am in a 3year+ old relationship with my partner (27F), and recently we just moved in together. 

I don't have much experience in the dating / relationship world, and this is definitely the longest relationship I ever had. (only had like 3 overall). 

For quite some time now the feeling of attraction and excitement of meeting or being with my gf has basically disappeared, and during that time, I keep having long term crushes and ""uncontrollable"" flirting conversations with other women

"So i just finished life is strange and was looking for games or media similar to it in terms of superpowers

(Fair warning, minor spoilers inside)
Basically what i really liked about the game was how maxes time manipulation was at best a B plot of the game, rather than being the main focus of it (apart from episode five) and was wondering if you know of any other games, movies, animes, books, anything really that approaches superpowers in a more.. slice of life sort of way. where the superpower isn't what the game is about.","NO"

"Advice for first time airplane and time zone traveling with baby?

In October, I will be going to a conference, and my family will join me for the weekend. LO will be 9 months then. We have a couple of concerns - 

1) Although we're taking the same plane back, we are taking different flights over (different times). SO will have the LO to himself on the flight over, so LO can't be nursed for the flights. He's not great at taking a cold bottle. Suggestions on how to make the flights do-able? 

2) We will be moving from central to pacific time zone (back 2 hrs, and then forward 2 hrs when we come back home). SO and LO will be on at the conference site Friday through Monday (3 nights). Is there anything we can do to prepare now? should we shift the time gradually? should we shift time at all for such a short period? 

3) We will be staying at an Airb'n'b and they do not have crib accommodations. Any suggestions on how LO might sleep? We have a pack'n'play, but between the stroller, car seat, and car base, we're taking a lot for LO already. Would 1 parent be able to take a pack'n'play and mattress with all the rest of the stuff? 

Thanks in advance, all!

"The last panel baby...

...is Eren's and Mikasa's child. 
Yeah, you'll say Historia is the only pregnant person but I think she and her baby will die during the childbirth. And people assume that Mikasa is also pregnant. 
In the last chapter Eren looked worried at Mikasa when he saw her on the battlefield. He was probably afraid because of their child. 
He tries to protect her but her Ackerman bond is the reason why she always fight (for Eren). 
For not risking her life she needs to stay away from him. That's the reason why Eren lied to her.

"Wreck of the Berrenger approx. location?

I'm having trouble finding it, and Eleutheria's ability to block the Intrepid Cavy from identifying what it found is making it much more difficult. Combine that with the low visibility and lack of an ability to speed up my engine/exploration, and I'm starting to get really angry. It's actually taking some of the fun out of the game.

Can anyone here at least tell me what Port or Ports are nearby?

"B/W album/song cover of punk girls walking off a sidewalk into road

Haven‚Äôt heard this song since like 2018-19 in the height of my Life is Strange phase. I found it in YouTube. I remember the album/song cover but hardly anything from the song. 
All female band or female lead alternative/punk fashion. The cover was black and white and it was of 3-4 people walking off of a sidewalk into the street with a corner store behind them and they were looking down. The song itself I vaguely remember it being a song about someone in a negative and somber tone it was indie/post punk/ grunge music it got loud though. It felt very ‚ÄúI hate you you did this to me I want revenge‚Äù that vibe. I think the band name was ‚ÄúThe ___ ‚Äù Like ‚Äúthe sirens‚Äù ( I‚Äôm pretty sure it started with an S.) and the song title was something in red font on the cover and I remember the song name being shorter than the band name. But the song name was in the lyrics a lot.. I keep thinking that‚Äôs it‚Äôs Siouxxsie and the Banshees or Pale Waves but it doesn‚Äôt seem it. Same vibe though.

"William Shakespeare, *Macbeth,* and *Hamlet*

[William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare) lived a storied life long ago. the [book](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxLT3kNQs-sd3U0RS1aMlNuYUU) can give you a brief intro to his life, and you can augment that with some of my [notes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GaVb6aowIhAW6fWKfYwDpDQgXOfgkM7cEe-r2DfqY6U). There was great turmoil in institutions - like [religion](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxLT3kNQs-sU0I3cWxfQVZCM0k) - in the time around his life, and it all impacted his [poetry](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxLT3kNQs-sUzlSQW9OUk5uNjQ) and plays.

Speaking of plays, the two we're looking at are (some spoilers ahead, mostly in the Wikis and the *Sparknotes*):

*Macbeth*

* This play is based on loosely on the life of a real Scottish king named, [Macbeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth,_King_of_Scotland) who was married to [Lady Macbeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruoch_of_Scotland) a woman named [Gruoch](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxLT3kNQs-sQWpURVRtdzc4cmc). The [source material](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxLT3kNQs-sQ0o2LVk3X19YNFE) he drew on needed to be changed at least a *little bit* because of the character Banquo and his supposed relation to King James; we'll discuss that, so don't worry. Here is a link to the folder containing all of the play's [study guides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxLT3kNQs-scGd4WElycEhNdVE), but if they're not enough, the tools available on [No Fear *Macbeth*](https://www.sparknotes.com/nofear/shakespeare/macbeth/) should help. Just be aware that I've read that stuff, and at the end of the day, I want *your* analysis not theirs. Though Shakespeare's [words](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxLT3kNQs-sd2tSYXdtdHIzaEE) may be difficult to understand, with a bit of effort - and the help of the modern [edits](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxLT3kNQs-sMkkySEVRbVJmWmc) - it becomes easier to grasp.

At the end of the play, the homework question you must answer is: Who is to blame for the outcome of the play?

*Hamlet*

* Arguably the most famous play ever written, this one is a doozy, full of moments referred to by other works and endlessly [referenced](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uoa9VMJmj-_lc2SCZPua5frb6ggAUmD0). Heck, even [Adventure Time](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxLT3kNQs-sYk9pY1lpVTBuMjg) and [Disney](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15c8Eyy3YhljHoGTLR5tsmgpw6OOteh11) in [*The Lion King*](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxLT3kNQs-sTWtncDVaamR5cmc) have leaned on the play for inspiration. The play's characters have some odd names like [Polonius](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxLT3kNQs-sN0RRSVEzb2VpMmM) and [Gertrude](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jaHBDdVKELvlF48XTr2ollrB4A8j2mqv) just to name two, but they're nowhere near as odd as those found in the [source material](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxLT3kNQs-sLTZCNks0NW41Vkk) from which he drew his inspiration. Just like *Macbeth*, this play has a [No Fear](https://www.sparknotes.com/nofear/shakespeare/hamlet/) page as well, but I give you the same caveat in regards using its content. Finally, in lieu of study guides, an [Event Log/Character Journal](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByxLT3kNQs-sVXoyUWZqVFJYaEE) will form the basis for the major assignments in this work. 

One other note for *Hamlet,* there's an obscure reference to the story of Jesus turning a girl into an owl. It's a blending of Biblical events and a Celtic myth, and the nearest to the story I've ever seen is [this](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SSIMaUzjjFYJO0U-H69hExggMGtXBsYC).

At the end of the play , the homework question you must answer is: Does Hamlet really love Ophelia?

For both plays, I'll intersperse a few more questions, and I'll update this post as more things occur to me.","NO"

These days I haul most my inspiration from Jack Kerouac, but seeing how I‚Äôve been writing since I was nine I have more thought towards spelling shit right. I fit more than five-hundred words on a composition book page, and I write at least two pages a day, though I wrote nine last night after a few drinks, but I‚Äôve  been wondering what other folks write like. Living how I do, I don‚Äôt have a bandcamp, so I joke, say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a ghetto rednecked hippy‚Äù when I talk to folks that don‚Äôt know me.

The scenario is this: The two of us are co-workers or roommates, and one of us comes across a magical notebook. Anything you write or draw in the book becomes true. If you wanted to see me in Sailor Moon buns, just write or draw it and I'd have that hairstyle. A person changed by the book can still react to the changes, unless the writer specifies otherwise.

I'd prefer to be changed, but I'm also open to changing you or mutual changes.

Transformations I like: Gender TF, Age regression, Mental manipulation, size change, mythical creatures( like fairies or angels)

Hard Limits: No scat, gore or anthro.

For this RP, the transformation and reactions to it are most important. Sex might happen, but it's not critical to the RP.","NO"

Disclaimer; This is not a chapter 1 intro post 

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not too much further away.‚Äù Adamis looked back at Trindall. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt this remind you of when we were kids? We‚Äôd pretend to go on adventures together. You, me, Illy, and the others. Sticks n‚Äô hand swinging them like swords. Remember when we first met? You took me to your secret place. What was it called again?... Something funny.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCornmeal. It was called cornmeal.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs it! Castle Cornmeal. Named after Oaf‚Äôs favorite breakfast!‚Äù Adamis laughed. 

*‚Äú*When we were in castle Cornmeal, you weren‚Äôt like this,‚Äù Trindall grumbled under his breath. He swung his slender silver sickle, cutting a low hanging branch. ‚ÄúHow much further is, ‚Äò*not too much further*‚Äô? We‚Äôve been at this for hours.‚Äù 

The boys had been walking through the wood since high noon. Although a path had been marked for them to follow, the foliage had reclaimed the path as its own. These naturally formed barriers had slowed their pace significantly. 

Adamis laughed and his hand swatted forward. ‚ÄúDamn Spiders.‚Äù He stepped onto a cracked log that spanned a small stream. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know once we get there. You‚Äôre not tired already, are you?‚Äù 

Trindall waited for Adamis to finish crossing the green and yellow moss-covered log before he stepped onto it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not tired. You know I grew up helping on the farm. Real work. Not like you, being waited on by servants in a castle all day. A little bit of walking won‚Äôt kill me. These woods‚Ä¶ these woods might.‚Äù He hopped off the log next to Adamis. 

‚ÄúThe woods, the woods,‚Äù Adamis mocked, ‚Äúif you say that one more time I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you turned into a tree by dusk.‚Äù

‚ÄúDusk is it? Shouldn‚Äôt have to wait too much longer then.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt that be ironic? If at dusk I turned to talk to you. You‚Äôd be there, but not. A tree! Imagine that, turning into a thing you hate, in a place you hate.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate trees. I hate these woods,‚Äù Trindall interrupted. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be a terrible tree,‚Äù Adamis continued, ‚Äúso afraid of the woods, you wouldn‚Äôt even need wind to shake. So afraid of the woods, I‚Äôm afraid your insides would turn. You‚Äôd rot inside out.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf that did happen, I‚Äôd make sure to wait, just so I could fall on top of you.‚Äù 

The boys continued walking. They used their sickles to cut through the dense overgrowth. Adamis walked over to a tall and thick tree. He placed his hand on the trunk. The bark was stripped, creating a soft and smooth reddish patch. Trindall watched Adamis as he touched the tree and a thought came to mind.

‚ÄúHey Adamis,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been meaning to ask this for awhile now. All of these marks‚Ä¶ They were made by you?‚Äù  

‚ÄúEvery last one.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhen did you have time to do that? It must‚Äôve taken days. Didn‚Äôt your father ask where you‚Äôd been?‚Äù Trindall asked. 

Adamis slowly removed his palm from the smooth spot on the tree. The white on his palm was partially covered in a reddish gooey sap. He patted his hands together, liberating them of some of the sticky sap. 

‚ÄúI did a bit here n‚Äô there. It didn‚Äôt take as long as you‚Äôd think,‚Äù he said, nonchalantly. 

‚ÄúIs that so‚Ä¶,‚Äù Trindall said unconvinced, ‚ÄúHow did you even know where to mark? Just finding whatever this place is must‚Äôve taken a long time. You‚Äôve been giving me a lot of vague answers lately‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúVague answers, what do you mean?‚Äù Adamis furrowed his brow as he spoke. 

*Trindall pondered, does he really not notice?* ‚ÄúVague answers are vague answers! How else could you take it? I‚Äôve asked where we‚Äôre going, and you won‚Äôt tell me. I‚Äôve asked how you found it, you won‚Äôt tell me. I‚Äôve asked how long it took you to mark the path, and you won‚Äôt tell me. Why‚Äôre you being so secretive?‚Äù Trindall‚Äôs chest heaved up and down as he spoke. 

Adamis stared blankly at Trindall. Trindall looked back at Adamis, waiting for a response. His hands clenched tightly inside of the sleeves of his undershirt. He let his nails dig into the fatty part of his palm, and then he relaxed them. He had thought that Adamis had been acting strange for a while, and had wanted to mention this before. It was only now that it had materialized. Finally, without saying anything, Adamis began to slowly walk towards Trindall.  

Trindall took one staged step backwards. ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you talking? What‚Äôs wrong with you? I‚Äôm going to leave if you keep this up.‚Äù 

Adamis had now arrived in front of Trindall. He was less than an arm‚Äôs length away. He placed his hand on Trindall‚Äôs shoulder and looked into his eyes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in your head,‚Äù He said dryly. His lips moving slowly as he spoke. Then, he burst into laughter. 

Trindall brushed Adamis‚Äôs hand off of his shoulder. ‚ÄúIn my head? I‚Äôve known you for how long now? I think I know when you‚Äôve been acting strange!‚Äù  

‚ÄúYes, in your head! I think you‚Äôre just afraid of being in the woods and trying to find an excuse to leave,‚Äù Adamis said, ‚ÄúCome now. Enough of this, ‚Äò*you‚Äôve changed nonsense*‚Äô. Let‚Äôs keep walking.‚Äù

Adamis turned, continuing along the pre-marked path. Trindall followed. Same as before, the boys were soon accompanied by the sounds of snapping twigs and sickle against brush. He wanted to continue the conversation, but he knew how Adamis was. Never liked to talk about his emotions much. It had always been that way. Even when they were children. Trindall recalled a time that Adamis had left the castle to come visit him at his parent‚Äôs house. His eye black, and his hand swollen. Couldn‚Äôt even hold a broom right. Ma‚Äô n Pa‚Äô asked him what had happened, but he wouldn‚Äôt give too much detail. Only saying it was an accident. Some accident. Looked like he caught the hoof of a horse, it did. 

Lost in thought, Trindall nearly missed the blackening of night. A cold and furious wind nipped at his skin, bringing him back from his mental recess. He tugged at his tattered and worn cloak in an attempt to shield his flesh from the assault of the wind. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting cold, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù 

‚ÄúJust a bit,‚Äù Adamis answered, ‚Äúthe sun‚Äôs setting and the winds picking up.‚Äù 

*Snap!* 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù Trindall yelped, ‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI did.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat do you think it was?‚Äù Trindall stared in the direction of the sound as he asked. He braced himself, his grip tightening on the sickle. 

‚ÄúJust some dumb animal, probably.‚Äù 

‚ÄúJust some dumb animal? It had to be big! You heard how loud that snap was. If we die out here, your father would find my ghost just to kill me again!‚Äù Trindall shuttered. Between the thought of Adamis‚Äôs father being angered or facing whatever beast was lurking in the wood he didn‚Äôt know which was better. 

Adamis stopped walking and joined Trindall, looking in the same direction. He didn‚Äôt know what had made the sound, but he was much less concerned than Trindall. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôre you so worried? If the beast comes, we‚Äôll kill it. If my father finds out we‚Äôre here, I‚Äôll say I forced you to come. Even if we did die, I doubt he‚Äôd care too much. He‚Äôd just legitimize one of his bastards and call it fair. I‚Äôm not his favorite anyways,‚Äù he said. His voice carried a tone of dissatisfaction.

‚ÄúI hope this is worth it. You might not be worried, but it‚Äôs not you that‚Äôll get skinned alive.‚Äù 

Adamis smiled and shook his head. ‚ÄúHold on for a second.‚Äù His body twisted and he lowered his shoulder. He removed the small brown deerskin sack that had been tightly strung across his chest and shoulder. He placed it on the ground and crouched. His hands began to rummage through the sack. ‚ÄúHere it is.‚Äù He pulled out a small wooden torch. ‚ÄúTake this.‚Äù 

Trindall received the torch and watched as Adamis began rummaging through his sack once again. After a short wait Adamis produced two rough stones, one a deep black and one a soft gray.

‚ÄúThe torch,‚Äù Adamis said. He beckoned Trindall as he spoke. 

Trindall held the torch sturdy. Adamis began to strike the stones together. The sound of stone on stone reverberated through the trees. Sparks bounced off of the stones as they collided. It wasn‚Äôt long before a few rebellious sparks escaped from the stones and found freedom atop the torch. The small orange and yellow flame on the torch danced in the wind. The soft warm glow reflected off of the young boys faces.

‚ÄúThere, some heat and some light. That should make you feel better, right? Now, if something comes towards us, we‚Äôll at least be able to see what it is. Nothing worse than a questioning death. Can you imagine that? Dying without knowing what happened, damned to haunt the wood‚Ä¶ searching,‚Äù Adamis said sarcastically. His expected laugh happening on que.  

‚ÄúIf we die out here, the only thing I‚Äôll be searching for is you!‚Äù 

Adamis laughed and placed the two stones back into his sack. ‚ÄúThe torch.‚Äù He removed his hand from the sack and held it open. 

Trindall hesitated before sighing and turning the torch over. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôre the prince, you know.‚Äù  

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you so worried about? If I would‚Äôve known that you‚Äôd jump out of your skin after every snap of a twig, I think I would‚Äôve brought Jhaan instead.‚Äù 

Trindall looked at Adamis‚Äôs face. Now illuminated by the flame, he could see the tips of Adamis‚Äôs ears reddening with anger.  

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ You know there‚Äôs not much that scares me. The woods‚Ä¶ they scare me.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs that? Is it the stories?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Trindall said softly, ‚Äúmy Nan‚Äô used to tell me stories about the wood. She said that it was full of terrifying things. Things so incredibly vile and defiled that they must not be seen. Just one look is enough to taint the soul. It blackens your heart and causes you to do all sorts of terrible things.‚Äù His hands trembled slightly as he spoke. 

‚ÄúNursery tales. Told by wet nurses to scare children to sleep. Not to make men piss their pants at the sight of a tree. We haven‚Äôt seen anything yet, just heard some twigs snappin‚Äô is all.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNursery tales my arse! My Nan‚Äô told me my uncle had entered the woods once. Genuine Gen they called him. Upright as they come. A farmer with not an evil bone in his body. Minded his own, but was never afraid to help. One day, his herding hound ran off. That bitch. Took off after something in the wood‚Äô she did. Barking up a storm. Gen followed it up to the tree line. He hesitated, but followed her in. Never found the bitch. Once he came out of the wood though, he had changed.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour Nan‚Äô said Gen changed? How‚Äôd he change? Did he grow wings? Did his farts smell of flowers? If that‚Äôs all there is to the story, then I think you might be even more timid than Illy was!‚Äù Adamis laughed. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not funny! You think that‚Äôd be enough to scare me? That‚Äôs not scary. What happens next is the real reason I hate these woods,‚Äù Trindall took a deep breath before continuing, ‚ÄúGen holed himself up inside the house after that. Cuts on his hands, and blood on the walls. Strange pictures he drew. No one could understand them. His wife, poor woman she was. Tried to help Gen, but nothing worked. She sent the kids off with my Ma‚Äô n‚Äô her Ma‚Äô n Pa‚Äô for a bit. One day though, Gen and the missus turned up to bring the kids home. Acted like nothing happened. He took the axe to‚Äôem that night. When their bodies were finally found, their limbs had been placed in a diagram of sorts. The person that found them said he was so shocked, he almost fainted on the spot. Once the townsfolk heard what happened they burnt the whole house down. Claimed it was black magic. Nan‚Äô says it was the woods though. Never did find Gen after that.‚Äù

‚ÄúMore nonsense! I doubt that story is true. Even if it is, maybe he was rotten all along.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs definitely true! My Nan‚Äô has never lied to me about nothin‚Äô. She even showed me where they lived and their graves. Every year, after the snow melts and when the flowers sprout she visits, bouquet in hand. I‚Äôm tellin‚Äô you. There‚Äôs something weird about these woods! Maybe we should head back. It‚Äôs already dark.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm telling you, that it‚Äôs all in your head. Really, once we get there you‚Äôll never have to come back. I promise. Of course, once you get there you‚Äôll never want to leave. It‚Äôs fantastic Trindall, it really is.‚Äù 

Trindall sighed. Adamis was not only his friend, but a prince. Not just a prince though, the next in line for succession. ‚Äò*How can I truly abandon him, if he isn‚Äôt willing to go?‚Äô* 

‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll keep going. That‚Äôs not the promise I want. I want you to promise you won‚Äôt ever ask me to come back to these damned woods again!‚Äù 

‚ÄúAlright alright,‚Äù Adamis reassured, ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt have to come back again. I promise.‚Äù 

‚ÄúGood! Lead the way then, my prince, I want to get this over with as soon as possible,‚Äù he said sarcastically. 

Although Trindall had told Adamis to lead the way, he continued his protest through silence. He stopped making idle chatter, and maintained a vigilant grip on his sickle. The frigid wind whipped through the trees, causing their wooden limbs to tremble. The flame on the torch flickered, almost extinguishing. It braced itself against the wind, clutching onto the torch. 

‚ÄúThe torch!‚Äù Trindall urgently said, watching it struggle for life. He stepped forward, blocking the wind and providing protection for his ally against the night. *That was close* he thought. Trindall eye‚Äôs drifted upwards from the torch onto Adamis‚Äôs face. Fully illuminated by the light, what Trindall saw terrified him. Adamis had a demented smile on his face. His eyes had blackened over, forming two bottomless spheres. ‚ÄúYour eyes! What happened to your eyes?‚Äù Trindall shrieked, falling backward onto his bum as he did.  

Adamis stopped and looked at Trindall. ‚ÄúAgain, with the antics? What do you mean my eyes? There‚Äôs nothing wrong with them. You couldn‚Äôt be falling in love with me, could you? Just one look is enough to make you faint!‚Äù Adamis laughed. 

Trindall stared at Adamis in disbelief. He rubbed his eyes and blinked. ‚Äò*No, this isn‚Äôt right. His eyes, they were different!*‚Äô He wanted to form words, but couldn‚Äôt. All he could manage to scrounge together was a stuttered mess of, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶what‚Ä¶‚Äù 

Adamis reached out a hand to help up Trindall. Trindall looked at the hand. It was pale and smooth for a man‚Äôs hand. However, this smooth pale hand raised a level of fear and caution inside of Trindall‚Äôs heart that he had never felt before. He raised his trembling hand and almost met Adamis‚Äôs grasp, but pulled away. He pressed his hands against the dirt, raising himself off of the ground.","NO"

"Anyone a student or graduate of the MBA/MFA dual degree program at NYU Stern &amp; Tisch?

Is anyone in this subreddit a current student, graduate, or prospect of the MBA/MFA dual degree program for General Business and Film &amp; Television Production at NYU Stern &amp; Tisch Kanbar?

Some of the questions that come into mind mostly have to do with admissions because I am having a difficult time finding answers for a niche dual degree program:

* I know you have to get accepted to both schools - What was the process like for you?
* I have seen videos posted by both Stern &amp; Tisch schools of MBA/MFA students coming into the program being one-sided (for example, business background with no film/television experience or a film/television background with no business experience, etc.) - How did you position yourself to get accepted to **BOTH** schools.
* I can't find class profiles for this dual degree program - What was your cohort like? How many are accepted into this dual program? How many people applied? How many people came from a film/television background? How many people came from a business background? Is the group racially diverse? Is there data on this anywhere?
* Did you use an MBA admissions consulting agency to help you with your admissions process? How did they assist you knowing that you are a dual degree prospect?
* I understand both Stern and Tisch are very prestigious schools and difficult to get into - Do you think applying to both schools was an advantage to you in getting accepted into the dual degree program? For example, Stern admissions admiring your pursuit to also earn an MFA to assist you in a goal for a strategy role at entertainment, film, television, streaming, etc. company

Here are some other questions that I have related to the program:

* How have you managed to pay for tuition? Has there been anyone who has had a scholarship with both schools? Is this possible to get a full ride in this dual degree program? Are your scholarship opportunities with Stern majorly limited due to being a dual student at Tisch? Are there scholarship opportunities for students in this dual degree program specifically?
* I know Stern allows MBA students the opportunity to select three specializations associated with their degree. Is this possible for MBA/MFA dual degree students to have three specializations or is the graduation pathway structured with the required credits that are taken for both schools?
* Do most students end up going the business route or the film/television route after graduation?
* For students who went the business route or are more business career-minded - Was finding jobs after graduation more difficult for you compared to your full-time MBA peers since you were enrolled in this dual degree program?
* I understand the semesters are split between the schools (one semester with Stern, one semester with Tisch). Although semesters are split does it feel like you are culturally ingrained with both schools and their activities at the same time or does it turn off and on between the semesters? Do you feel a disconnect from Stern or Tisch just because you're a dual degree student?
* Are dual MBA/MFA students considered a part of the class profile they are accepted into even though they graduate a year later compared to their full-time MBA student peers?
* I imagine the last semesters are the most challenging since you split time between both Stern and Tisch - How was the workload of taking business classes along with producing and directing your final capstones?

A little bit of background of myself: I first graduated with an associate's in television production and worked in film/television industry for a bit. The industry comes and goes in my location so I decided to go back to school and earn a bachelor's in business in hopes of finding a career more stable for financially supporting my family. After completing my bachelor's, I pivoted into digital marketing for the largest insurance agency in my state where I apply my video production and graphic design skills in my leadership and work. I want to eventually work my way into a business role for a large entertainment company (where the MBA will come in) but would be open to also producing films at one point down the road (where the MFA will come in). I just graduated undergrad though, so I am probably aiming to apply for this program in 4 years. As the time comes I will post a thorough profile review!

I'm sure there is a possibility that this post may not get any responses because the dual degree program is very niche and not many students come out of it - I just wanted to make this post a potential first resource for prospective students because I have searched every on this subreddit and the web and couldn't find much. I am sure some of the questions in the post are applicable to other dual degree programs like JD/MBA, MPP/MBA, MD/MBA prospects too (scholarship opportunities, culture from both schools, class profile information, etc.)

If you're a graduate or a current student in this program, I would love to connect! If anyone else is a prospect for this dual degree program, let's connect too! I would love to hear everyone's stories and experiences. Thanks!","NO"

"[Futa4A] Looking for some long-term, kinky fun!

Yep, I am doing exactly that. I want slow seduction, and I would love to hear your ideas. as I am usually swamped with messages when I post something like this, I'm requesting you give an outline of how you want the RP to go in your first message, as well as how cruel/brutal/loving you want me in the scenario. Also, feel free to message a while after this goes offline.


Anyways, yeah. If your male, I would prefer you start off as a masculine young man, but sissies are certainly welcome. if your female, I'm a little more open, though popular or athletic is good. If your a futa....we'll talk. Ideally, the sub should be apprehensive, but not totally willing nor totally unwilling. Also, make sure to tell me how cruel/brutal/loving you want me in the prompt.

And if you want a scenario where you dom a futa, I'm listening. I do prefer the sub futa to still be bigger, tho.


**I don't do real life domming, Only RPing. I also prefer for us to play as characters, not necessarily our real selves**


****

**Things I enjoy** (Not dealbreakers, just stuff I like)

* Female Muscle (duh. I really, really wanna incorporate this somehow into the RP)

* Emotional attachment

*  sounding/urethra insertions

* Monstergirl/monsterboy


* ditzy guys

* Boisterous guys

* Stoic guys with a gooey sub hidden under the hard exterior

* forced cock-riding

* himbo/bimbro

* character development

* something that feels genuine I geuss.

* Cuckqueaning

* I do like the overall idea of making you question your sexuality/gender identity....if your into that

* Truth-or-dare (yes, the game. It can be a lot of fun in an RP IMO)

* busty ladies can be fun. curvy gals in general, really

* Focus on how the dom is stronger than the sub (I like small people overpowering big guys. I know its not realistic,m but its my fantasy)


* Furry


*  sounding/urethra insertions


* ditzy ladies

* Boisterous ladies

* very shy ladies who are really kinky at heart

* Ladies who put up big badass shells, but in reality are just as gooey as anyone.

* forced cock-riding

* Face-sitting

* Bimbo

* Incest 

* Humiliation (of all kinds, public is nice)

* Ageplay

* dominant bottoms

* Tomboys and female crossdressers can be hot

* role reversal in general

* crossdressing (forced or willing)

* An apprehensive sub

* Kissing (forced kissing can be cool!)

* Smothering (ass, muscles, boobs, etc.)

* focus on how dom is bigger/better than sub (I kinda like a focus on strength, but superiority in other areas is fine)

* Forced bi (Maybe your ""straight"" and made to do stuff with gals, maybe your ""gay"" and fored to do stuff with guys? Just suggestions, of course) 

* Feminzation (Like, your a tomboy I turn into a princess. ya dig?)

* Masculinization (rare fetish, I know, but I think itd be interesting to try it. Like, making a more feminine woman masculine. )

* wedgies

* SUperheroes (Marvel, Dc, Chaos!, some Image.....we can discuss things)

* Public use

* Public humiliation

* Cbt

* Nipple play

* Spanking



* Feet and sweat focus

* Watersports (someone having no choice but to piss themself is kinda arousing to me)




***


**Things I tolerate** (As in, I'm kinda indifferent. Totally willing to actively participate if your a good partner, tho)

* am fairly indifferent towards furry, like it when it adds something to the RP. 

* scat under certain circumstances

* Petplay

* Bondage

* Blackmail


*****


**Things I really don't like**

* Inflation

* Multicock

* transformations

* Anything ridiculously gigantic  (Like, the high-end of possible is fine, but no 2' cocks or boobs that are bigger than the rest of us put together) 


***

RP Ideas: Just a few Sugestions, we don't have to do any

***

1. Masculine young man visits his futa aunt for a few weeks in the Summer. he gets seduced, humiliated, overpowered, sissified, whored out, and over thr course of the vacation, he resists a decen bit, but ultimately loves it!

2. Young woman visits her futa aunt, who abuses her some, but also teaches her a few lessons in how to overpower, seduce, and enslave potential mates

3. Futa mom does not like what her child's up to, decides to make it clear she's in charge and her child should more closely fit a certain standard.


4. I'm the new girl in town, your one of the top athletes at my new school. I make you mine


5. Something where an older, petite futa doms a much younger, more amazonian futa/female


6. we're friends, playing truth-or-dare


7. a nice monstergirl RP where I was an athletic minotauress getting dommed by a slender elf girl with a penchant for magic



8. younger futa at a camp physically bully and dominate the older boys(or older gals), but things end up getting more romantic





2. In a world where wfuta rule, its very hard for one to admit to her husband (or wife?) that she's totally submissive

1. I'm a futa just reaching that age where  my bullying of guys starts getting sexual


3. Your a gay male, I make you and your parnter mu sluts. I especially like this one if I play your mom.

1. You come from a land similar to ours, where women are larger and stronger than men, and men are seen as overemotional homemaking sex objects. You have been in America for a while, and enjoy the more patriarchal culture, but can't support yourself financially. I'm a young, well-off futa you shack up with , who ends up becoming much more to you.

2. in a world where there are no men, we live as a regular, incredibly passionate lesbian couple. have dates, shop for lingerie, have sex in front of cheering crowds at waterparks, regular couple stuff. 

2. Your a superhero, I dominate you (I can go a few different ways with this one. Alternatively, maybe something besiees superheroes? I am familiar with tns of Image, marvel, and DC characters, have just read most of Fables and am big on Conan the Barbarian. I haven't read a lot of manga nor seen a lot of anime, but I do know DBZ pretty well. I am familiar with most recent Western Cartoons, if you wanna try those.)

4. Cuck RP I always enjoyed: I'm your mother, and when you come home to visit with yoru SO, I seduce said SO right in front of you.

10. I'm your younger sister (ages can be discussed :) and pour parents view me as more responsible, as such they leave me in charge for a few weeks when they go away.

1. we're cellmates in a prison

2. I'm your babysitter (maybe your big sister) and decide to have some fun with you while your under my charge.","YES"

I'm on day 3 of keto and last night and tonight I've felt discomfort in my urethra. Last night I was certain it was a UTI. Exact same feeling, but not burning yet when I peed.

I drank some water with baking soda, as it has helped me prevent a full blown UTI before. This morning the discomfort wasn't there, so I figured everything was okay after all, and I went pretty much the whole day feeling normal. Now it's about 8pm and the same uti-like discomfort is back.

"DAY 2

Hi, I am 21 m, I have dedicated myself to do a journal update every day until my 90th day. today is day 2/90.  I have been watching porn and masturbating since the age of 14. I am tired of making excuses for myself and I want to change for the better. My goal is to reach 90 days to reboot my brain and then after that do it for life. 

I had one mini urge yesterday. I forced myself to not think about it, and I shrugged it off like it was nothing. After that, I came to r/nofap to distract myself from thinking about porn. I made a promise that I would not sleep in my bed for a week since it is the main cause of my relapses. Also going to the gym has made a big difference in my progress. For some reason when I go to the gym, it is less likely that I would fap on that day, and on the other hand, when I don't go, the occurrence of a relapse is more likely.  Overall I would say it was a success for the first 2 days!","NO"

"RPG server - finding the right balance

I have an RPG server that I'd like to have players beta test. I don't know if it's ready for production status yet, so I'm not going to post it to /r/mcservers. Is it inappropriate to ask if anyone would like an invite code to beta test here?

If yes, I'll strike this post. Otherwise, some of the things on that server might be of interest to /r/admincraft.

First off, it's original server design. I've been tweaking the plugins for a long time, trying to craft a specific experience. Worldpainted map. Many custom plugins only for this server. Mages, rogues, and warriors are the classes, and they climb based on XP. When you die, you lose everything and start over. So that permadeath is pretty serious. There's no teleports, or /home, or anything. Farming, mining, mobs are all much harder. There are adventure areas with loot chests, and adventure cities where players can rent rooms, drink ale, buy food, armor, horses, etc.

The economy is something I'm hopeful for. Players can sell raw meat to the butcher, or mob heads to the constable (there are bounties), or various other goods. Using that money, they can buy other stuff from a few server shops. Players can also set up shops, and sell directly to each other (although these shops aren't infinite). Overall, I think it's a good economy balance. But I'd like you to be the judge. I'm open for criticism, tell me what I'm doing wrong and how it's failing, so I can make it better.

No links etc, because I want to know if this is an OK post here first. If the community is interested, I'll post more details. If not, I'll remove it. Let me know, cats. Thanks.","NO"

"Lambda, embeded events and whatnot

Recently I learned about lambda expressions and events, and I wanted to use it in my app.

Apparently, what I'm doing is wrong, because the app is going crazy after I click the ""Read"" button.

I'm developing app for Win8 .  
The problem in short: The stack of last pages is loading more than one instance of Reader page with random parameter (with random parameter - see the code below) no matter what story I'm selecting.

The code:

	FFSubcategory subcategory = //Is inherited from previous page... something something NavigationParameters
	private void Reload() {
		await var stories = subcategory.GetListOfStories();
		foreach(FFStory story in stories)
		{
			UserControls.StoryBox sb = new StoryBox();
			// ... 
			sb. Click += (sb, e) =&gt; 
			{
				//... show something, osme menu, something &amp; popup.isOpen = true;
				var options = //Get the child op popup (ListBox)
				options.SelectionChanged += (o2, e2) =&gt;
				{
					//Depending on option do something
					//if index = 1
					this.Frame.Navigate(typeof(Readr), sb.storyRef); // &lt;== Really important line
				};

			};
		}
	}

	private void PageLoaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) 
	{
		// ... 
		Reload();
		//...
	}

I‚Äôve started my career with an average salary of 20k per month. My work got stagnated and there is literally nothing new to learn.

"The current state of Kayfabe. (A thought/rant provoked by WKPW Podcast 1/12/18)

This started as an email to wade Keller but I just kept going and thought I‚Äôd save him the time to see how long it was and delete it and post to the IWC the best way I know how.

On the 1/12/18 episode, the conversation with Andrew Goldstein really got me to thinking and wanting to express thoughts I‚Äôve had for a while. They talked about how Jinder Mahal would go on podcast and talk about things and breaking kayfabe, which I agree is hurting the business in a way. The way I look at it is that these guys are now playing characters on TV, but they are keeping their tv names and doing interviews as their real person. We had Yuvraj Singh Dhesi (yes I had to google that name) giving an interviews talking about his life, but it was titled as and constantly referred to as a Jinder Mahal interview. The problem is that wasn‚Äôt Jinder, it was Yuvraj. It works well when Brock Lesnar or John Cena do those interviews, because they live their character. Yes they do turn it up on TV, but they are not going around killing their TV character by being a completely different person with the same TV name. John Snow  or (insert any other TV character) doesn‚Äôt go on podcast or interviews talking about how catering was, or the drama with production etc, the actor Kit Harrington might though. I know it‚Äôs because WWE won‚Äôt allow the talents to get anything besides their branded and owned name to be popular, but it‚Äôs really confusing to anyone I‚Äôve ever tried to explain wrestling to. It‚Äôs also the same with social media, it‚Äôs so inconsistent. Sometimes their tweets are even used on Tv and worked into storylines, but then the next week two rivals or a ‚Äúheel‚Äù and ‚Äúface‚Äù are taking pictures together on trips. Or guys like Curt Hawkins has his real name as his twitter name. I understand it can‚Äôt be 100% all kayfabe, but I think it could atleast be consistent. Instead of PPV bonuses, maybe they could do a kayfabe consistent bonus. Also the UUDD YouTube channel, seeing the backstage of a WWE show, but not like the backstage segments, but instead guys completely out of character. I like the channel but seeing these guys all in the locker room like that is cool, but If I saw that as a kid in 1997 I would have been so mad at Rey Mysterio Jr playing Madden with Kevin Nash after being darted into a production truck. (Timing is probably off but you get the jest)

While a lot of this has to do with WWE but I think we as hardcore fans have some blame as well. Do you think that if there was a kayfabe only site and podcast, maybe even WWE owned, would help or could even work? There is always more room for content on the internet; and I honestly don‚Äôt know of any real kayfabe-ish content to consume. While I do still love pro wrestling, I just wish there was a place or promotion that could keep some kayfabe. Yes it is 2018 and we all know it‚Äôs fake, but we also know pretty much EVERYTHING ON TV IS FAKE. All of my girl friends that watch Reality TV like the Kardashians know it‚Äôs all manufactured, they create their storylines and film it, and for the most part they live the gimmick, and they could be credited with starting that culture. A lot of people curate their lives to look like the ‚Äúgimmick‚Äù they want to portray, but the originators of kayfabe have gone the complete opposite route.

I do think that there is a real opportunity for IMPACT to fill this void. Allowing their talent to keep and own their gimmicks is a good start, but also not having so much content to produce and keep up with like WWE could be a real positive also. With the wrestling business arguably the best it has ever been, who am I to tell anyone how to do business, but as a fan I really miss being able to immerse myself in the world. While I do break this myself by listening to podcast and such, but I have the ability to separate the two and would love to have some kayfabe content to consume as well.","NO"

Sounds stupid but I was never really good at philosophy and abstract stuff or whatever.

I mean, in the back of my mind I was always like yeah but that's what the bible said. Anyways, claim 1. Jesus rose form the dead. Claim 2. There were witnesses. It's really just a chain.

"don't use Lunar Oracle by Liberty Phi unless

I made the mistake of buying Lunar Oracle by Liberty Phi without reviewing it and boy is it super fucking confusing. I am naturally drawn to oracle cards as my practice and I wanted to incorporate lunar magic with my stuff. This book right off the bat on page 18 and 19 has a diagram of the moon cycle. And I swear to God I had such a hard time reading this and figuring out the order and pattern. Turns out they used the wrong images to represent first quarter, waxing gibbous, waning gibbous, third quarter, and waxing crescent. They also didn't specify the order of the circle diagram whether it was clockwise or counter clockwise. There are no pages to look back onto once you have a spread because none of the cards have a page in the booklet that has definition to add onto. It's just the definition given from the card which isn't a lot of context. And then there's a bunch of random facts about what your astrological moon is, like that's half the book without context of sidereal or tropical astrology. And then random astrological gardening info, birthstone info, what oil you should use for new moon and full moon rituals depending on the astrological sign it is in. They only have rituals and reading spreads based on new and full moon as if other moon phases like first quarter and last quarter don't exist (and 4 other phases)?? And the order of everything is difficult to navigate that looking at the table of contents everything you do something is the only way to make sense because the order of these subjects are just way too confusing. I can usually remember the subjects and understand where parts would be, but this book has a very inconsistent navigation style and needs to relabel their chapter and then subcategories. There are 36 cards split evenly into 3 groups, new moon, full moon, and wild card? As if it's like there's only those 3?? And the references used for new moon and full moon in the art depiction on the cards does not show enough contrast to display it is what it means. Im all for interpreting symbols from oracle cards but like if there is no reference in the booklet to add on to the definition of these cards then its easy to make a mistake with looking at a card that says full moon but has a newmoon image on it. There needs to be context given! There's only three pages of lunar oracle spreads to reference off of for this product called *Lunar Oracle*. 


TLDR
This book is for anyone who isn't bothered by scribbling out the incorrect diagrams and recorrectng it, who prefers simple oracle cards with no definition lookup, who isn't a novice or a pro to lunar cycles/magic/ritual/oracle, who specifically prefers more of an astrological lunar new moon and full moon magic and approach than anything else in their practice. Please watch review videos and use your own discretion when purchasing this set of oracle cards. I excluded novice and pro mainly because it's too confusing for new lunar magic users and not beneficial in wisdom for old lunar magic users that already know what they're doing. It's really more for an individual who likes an open concept to add to. 

I will be using these cards still but I just needed to let yall know. And please add on to anything! All my gripes with this have to do with not having enough structure or context and since I was branching out to incorporate both my seperate oracle practice and lunar practice into one. So really got under my skin when it felt like there was a lot of loose ends when that's just part of the book.","NO"

"[Russian &gt; English] Play Store Review

Hi people,

I'm struggling to translate it using traditional resources.

It is a Play Store review.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nearby.apps.hot.popular.com.hotappsnearby&amp;hl=ru (first one, 5 star)

It says:

I figured the first half, but the other part I'm helpless.

In fact, [young people are driving less](http://nypost.com/2016/01/31/why-are-fewer-young-people-getting-drivers-licenses/) and with Driver's licenses being the MOST acceptable form of ID in voting places, young people,poor, and minority people are disproportionally effected by these laws. There have been numerous studies that show **Registration and Voter ID laws do nothing to prevent voter fraud but do disproportionately effect young, poor and minority voters**.

### How Does Voter Registration Effect Bernie?
- Bernie consistently outperforms the polls. The polls conducted do not account for the huge amounts of first time primary voters on the democratic side or independents. 
- People become familiar with Bernie relatively close to the elections. Polls change dramatically from a month or even a week before election to the day of or day before.

- This is great news for Bernie, but it doesn't mean much if first time primary voters have not registered to vote. Many states have voter registration deadlines(OH, MO, Illinois) but do have open primaries. Because people find out about Bernie so late they often miss the deadlines to register. OH, MO and Illinois both had Feb 16th deadlines, almost a whole MONTH before the election. Voter ID laws in these states also effect young, poor, minority voters.

###Most Americans Identify as Independents:
- Independents made up about 1/3 of Michigan's Democratic primary voters. Polls in Michigan did not account for Independent turnout or the fact that Bernie wins amongst Independents by about 65-35%. Any exit polling data will show that Bernie DOMINATES Clinton [when it comes to Independents](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/sanderss-party-problem/460293/). 

- In addition, almost 32% of Americans now consider themselves Independents and Democratic party registration and identification  has consistently [dropped for years](http://www.people-press.org/2015/04/07/a-deep-dive-into-party-affiliation/).

###The Big Issue:
- Upcoming states are going to be dominated by closed primaries. New York, Maryland, NJ, and many other east-coast liberal leaning states are going to be effected in the same ways Illinois, NC, MO and OH were because of Voter ID and Registration laws.

- **New York** is probably already a lost cause. The deadlines to register(just to vote, not to vote as a democrat) were back in October when Bernie still had little if any recognition. The deadline for people who have registered as Democrats is **March 25**

- States like AZ and upcoming primaries, though important are not nearly as valuable as PA, NY, MD, CA and other states that have way more delegates that Bernie desperately needs.  More importantly, he cannot make up the delegate lead in these States and not **emphasizing voter registration and proper ID** in important states that he SHOULD win (like MA) will end in ties and more disappointment. Except then it will be too late!

### Why This All Matters:
- Bernie supporters are basically getting punished for not being Democrats. Nowhere in the constitution does it say being a Republic or Democrat is necessary to vote for president.

- **Independents and first time primary goers helped Obama win the nomination in 08, it can be done again. Back then Voter ID &amp; Registration laws were not as common.**

###What You Can Do:
- Register. Check out voterforbernie.org for when registration deadlines and ID requirements.
- Make sure other Bernie Supporters register and have proper identification.

- Emphasize Registration in NY, PA, MD, and other east-coast states! This is Bernie's best chance to make up the delegate lead/not get left behind by Clinton.

- [**Sign this petition**](http://www.openprimaries.org), share this website, talk to local representatives.

Important Resources:
-[Upcoming Open/Closed Primaries](http://www.openprimaries.org/primaries_by_state)
- Registration info: voterforbernie.org

Please: We have limited amounts of time. Most primaries on the east cost will close registration in about a week. If we don't get Bernie's message out to these people and make sure they register by then we will have no path to the nomination.","NO"

"[S3 Finale Spoilers] Some questions

- Why wasnt Frank able to take Claire in the Iowa hotel room, does he no longer feel physically attracted to Claire (hard to believe)?
Also, what was the point of that scene? Claire seems to want more more power, and step out of Frank's shadow but at the same time wants to be posessed by him in the bedroom which contradicts what I understand about her.

- I'm oblivious to American politics but I'm to understand that states put down their votes one state at the time? What's the point in that? Why do Americans not all vote at the same time and then the candidate who has the biggest % of all the votes, wins? This is what happens in the EU and makes a lot more sense to me.

- Now for some speculation, with Claire leaving Frank. What is she planning to do in the future? Run herself as a candidate? A bit too late for that I assume?

"If there is an AFK player in the lobby, the considerate thing to do is to vote to kick them, not to just leave.

When you kick an obviously AFK player, the lobby is preserved with the other active players, and a replacement is usually brought in quickly.

When you leave a lobby with other active players because one person is AFK, the active players you left behind now have to (1) leave themselves, (2) continue to wait on the AFK, or (3) hope the person who replaces you is considerate enough to vote to kick. All of these options are worse than if you had just voted to kick the AFK.

Countless times I've been in lobbies with three green ticks and one person who is obviously not there, and only two people vote to kick them, with the third active player just leaving for some reason instead of putting in the third kick vote. I know the leaver is the person who refrained from voting because the two kick votes always remain even after they leave (I assume that your vote disappears if you leave the lobby).

Maybe those people think they are being nice by not kicking because ""kick"" sounds mean or whatever. **But leaving is the dick move in this circumstance.** You are screwing over the two other ready players. Please just vote to kick AFK people - it's the nice thing to do.","NO"

"26 [F4M] London - Seeking an inquisitive guy for intimate questioning.

Looking to be asked questions about intimate and private topics that people just don't speak about. Love to be quizzed intensely and deeply about personal topics as you go deeper and deeper in. These can include, but are not limited to: female specific stuff, ruder stuff, stuff you wouldnt normally talk about(periods/toilet) specifics about my own body, specifics about sexual meets, anything that is incredibly embarrassing or intimate to talk about. Thanks and ask your first question in your message. The more unique and more detailed it is, the higher chance of a reply! Happy to tell you literally any detail you want to know - nothing is off limits for this. Just put effort into your reply please!

Posted this a lot of times. If I havent replied before its because you havent been unique enough or your reply wasnt good enough! Im looking for a long running conversation where I can tell you literally everything you want to know about me and my body, even if its something super embarrassing. You should ideally love to prod and poke around and find out everything specific. Obviously sex is a key part but im not looking for questions just about sex - i want just everything thats intimate knowledge and specifics that noone else would know. Sex is obviously fun though! Please put effort into your reply - I wont reply if it is just one or two sentences.

You should ideally be an inquisitive guy who loves finding out information about stuff that is embarrassing or stuff that isnt talked about often. You can gain the ability to find out literally everything about me and that is what I like about this. I dont necessarily get off on this so dont be expecting that - but I dont care if you do and I like that people could get off on knowing stuff about me. Thanks! Ive put a lot of effort into this post and although I do post a lot im still looking for someone special to talk to about this. Also sorry but no matter how rude it may seem I am only really looking to answer - its not that i'm not interested or anything its just how I like it. As long as you are into it im happy to give as detailed answers as you desire, answering every specific that I possibly can. Thanks!","YES"

"Aireloom by Macy's

My wife and I are in the market for a new mattress.  We're both average-sized individuals, but I'm much pickier, so she sent me on the initial scouting mission to test out mattresses.  Went shopping at Macy's and fell in love with one of their Aireloom hybrid models (https://www.macys.com/shop/product/aireloom-hybrid-13.5-luxury-firm-mattress-collection?ID=8924260).  It's on closeout because they will supposedly be discontinuing the model in the next few months (I somehow doubt that the price is truly 58% off, though).

We're both combination sleepers, so I laid on it a few times for several minutes at a time, and in different positions.  I felt very comfortable throughout (almost fell asleep at one point!).

I have two hesitations with it though:
1) I understand that Aireloom makes lines of mattresses for Macy's that are lower quality than their typical standards.  I already noticed that the coil count is about 20% lower than normal. Will this mattress last at least 7-8 years if we are diligent about rotating it quarterly?  Or would we be overpaying for something that's no better than an average ""s-brand""?

2) Macy's doesn't have the best return policy - they charge a restocking fee of 15% + $100 to return or exchange a mattress within 120 days.  I can see it from their perspective...they can't resell a mattress at full price once it's been used for a few months, but at the same time, many online retailers offer a more generous return policy since people are buying their mattresses sight-unseen.  What's the likelihood that we'll want to return a mattress after testing it out several times at the store?

Any input will be much appreciated!","NO"

"Mentally Challenged Assisted Living in NV?

Hello Vegas locals,

I am posting this as a desperate call for help. My uncle, 55yo, was born deaf and faces other mental handicaps. He has never had a place of his own, and does not get much help from the state. (I believe he gets about $800 a month).

As some will probably feel what I am about to say next comes off as rude, he has been babied because of certain conditions his entire life, and has never had any real life responsibilities. He lived with my grandmother his entire life, and after she had passed, my mother took him. Going on almost 5 years of this, it is beginning to slowly ruin a marriage, and has sadly become a toxic household. No body seems to be happy with him being there, and he doesn‚Äôt seem to want to be there in the first place.

As we are researching possible assisted living scenarios due to his hearing and mental disabilities, we aren‚Äôt coming across many options. Has anyone else ever had to deal with a situation like this? 

I really appreciate any options / recommendations / thoughts any of you might have.

"Am I supposed to know the settlement amount?

This happened to my mother and sister in Texas in the beginning of January. 

She was driving my sister to work when they came to a complete stop at a stop light. 

A Border Patrol truck rear ended them, and my sister and mother needed to go to the hospital and physical therapy for a few months. 

They had plenty of witnesses and video evidence supporting their claim. 

They immediately got a lawyer to sue for damages, but the case has been stalled for almost a year due to Covid. 

My mother called me to ask if it was normal for lawyers to send a settlement amount without consulting her or my sister, whom they are representing. 

The lawyer hasn't called back my mother in the past few weeks, and her aide keeps telling my mom that she (the lawyer) will call her back when available. 

Should my mother get another lawyer? Should she be worried about any hanky-panky going on?","NO"

"Remake do formul√°rio para pessoas que tiraram cursos profissionais

Boas Portugueses!

QUESTION√ÅRIO: https://goo.gl/forms/XeY15HengKOL4Jui2

Infelizmente o formul√°rio que partilhei aqui na semana passada ficou com dados extremamente inconsistentes.
A culpa √© minha pois n√£o tive muita aten√ß√£o na conce√ß√£o do mesmo e simplifiquei demais.

Por este motivo refiz o formul√°rio, tendo em conta os v√°rios tipos poss√≠veis de estudantes, estruturando e restringindo acesso a certas partes consoante esse tipo de estudante (o que foi fazer depois do curso - estudar, trabalhar, trabalhar e estudar, ou outras).

Afinal, errar √© humano...

Agrade√ßo a todos os portugueses que tenham tirado cursos profissionais, que possam tirar 2 minutos do vosso dia para responder a este question√°rio, pois a minha nota final de matem√°tica deste ano depende do mesmo.

Os melhores cumprimentos,
Um resto de um bom dia!

"Martyrs Of Monarchy Part 1

One of the most famous martyrs is Tsar Nicholas II. He was horrifically shot on July 17, 1918 by the reds in the russian civil war who were worried of the approaching white armies. While he was not perfect he did care for his subjects unlike most of the tyrants of the USSR. Shown by one of his first acts as king on 30 May 1896 was to have a party for his people giving out free food and drinks. Which was so popular to his subjects it became a stampede which injured and even killed some people. It wasn't just him who was shot it was a large chunk of the Romanov family. He died becoming a martyr to our cause showing that the so called 'liberation' of communism comes at a heavy price not just in money or infrastructure but in blood.

"Atheists, liberals and Islam

I don't know how much you've been paying attention to this, but from what I understand, there are liberals going after atheists like Bill Maher (a big liberal, btw) and Sam Harris for their position on Islam being - as Harris has said - ""the mother lode of bad ideas"". As I understand the criticism from this part of the political left, Maher, Harris and other 'New Atheists' are *bigoted* against Muslims by holding this view.

I am a liberal. I am an atheist. I agree that Islam is the mother lode of bad ideas. That doesn't mean I am against Muslims in anyway (nor do I think Harris and Maher are). They are, and I am, bigoted against *Islam* in that it can be ""mined"" in such a way as to convince assholes like Al Qaeda and ISIS to wage jihad against anyone who disagrees with their interpretation of the Koran. That is **not** bigotry against Muslims.

I am also bigoted against Christianity and Judaism (or any faith) when it is used is ways that harm people.  To be bigoted against Christians or Jews would be to have a prejudice (pre-judging) them as individuals, before knowing anything more about them other than their faith. That is *not* the same as a prejudice against the *religion*. In fact, while I am also anti-religion, if you keep your spiritual beliefs out of my government, I could not care less about what you believe (unless you're a scientologist, but that is another story for another time).

As the saying goes, we can disagree without being disagreeable. I'd be interested in your thoughts, as I am also going to post this to r/liberal to get theirs.","YES"

"BHEX Bitcoin Options ‚Äî An Alternative Hedging Tools for Crypto Miners

With the rising costs of mining, combined with Hashrate competition, fluctuations in the cryptocurrency price, and various other reasons, have resulted in **increased instability in total mining profits**. Additionally, once the value of any cryptocurrency falls below the mining cost, the high electricity bill and low output will simply cause miners to choose to turn off their mining machines‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääresulting in a loss of investment.

&amp;#x200B;

Although many mines have opened mining models with pre-paid income, if the market fluctuates drastically and does not transfer assets in time, once the price of the cryptocurrency falls, the income will still be affected.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, choosing financial derivatives as a tool to hedge the risks brought by price fluctuations is a relatively ‚Äúsmart‚Äù approach for the majority of miners.

&amp;#x200B;

Hedging, in simple terms, is to use the same pattern of price movements in the spot market and the derivatives market, and to operate in the spot market and the derivatives market with the same cryptocurrency, equal quantity, and opposite direction. **No matter how the price fluctuates in cryptocurrency, the profit and loss of the two-side operate at the same level to achieve the purpose of asset preservation**.

&amp;#x200B;

At present, futures and options are the two mainstream financial derivatives in the market. Which ones are more suitable as hedging tools for miners? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Let us look at an example:**

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming that the spot price of 1BTC on 15 April 2019 is 5000USDT, miner Bob expects to dig 10 BTC in a week. However, he fears that the cryptocurrency will fall at that time, and also he hopes to secure gains of each BTC at the unit price of 5000USDT in advance. Bob therefore has two options:

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Choose a platform futures contract for hedging**

Take a platform week contract as an example. Suppose the current contract price is 5000 USDT (assuming the contract price and the spot price are the same), use a BTC margin of 10 times leverage 1 BTC is used as 10 BTC). ) Open a short contract.

If the price of BTC drops to 4,500 USDT each after 1 week, sells the BTC in the spot market, the expected return is reduced by 500 USDT each. In the futures market, Bob has obtained 10 times of leverage and gained 10 times of return due to the price decline. The total gains were 1.11 BTCs at the time of settlement, and the spot price lost a total of 5000 USDT. In this way, Bob succeeded in achieving hedging.

However, if within this week, the BTC price will rise first and then fall, from 5000USDT to 5500USDT and then fall to 4500USDT. When the BTC price rises, it needs to increase the margin and increase the investment of funds. If the margin is not increased in time, Bob will be liquidated. Not only will he not have a successful hedging, but he will also lose all the principal, and will enlarge the loss.

**Method:** Open a weekly futures contract with 10 times leverage

**Cost:** 1 BTC, high capital occupancy rate

**Result:** There is a risk of forced liquidation under the fluctuation of the market, which is easy to enlarge the loss.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Choose BHEX Bitcoin option hedging**

Bob bought 10 put spreads at BHEX, and he will pay 1400 USDT as premium.

If the price of BTC fell to 4500USDT a week later, Bob sold the BTC as the spot market and would have lost 500USDT per BTC; yet, he could gain 5000USDT on BHEX options, reducing the loss.

If the BTC prices fluctuate heavily within a week, with the same up- and downtrends as before from 5000USDT to 5500USDT to 4500USDT, Bob‚Äôs position will not be affected, and he would still receive 5000USDT in earnings when the option expires.

**Method:** Buy BHEX put option

**Cost:** approximately 1400 USDT with low capital occupancy

**Results:** it can either be successfully hedged, or reduced the losses.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

By comparison, we can see that both futures and options products can meet the needs of miners‚Äô hedging. If the price of the cryptocurrency falls, you can hedge the risk and realize the purpose of asset preservation or loss reduction by opening the futures contract or buying the put option.

However, the capital utilisation rate of futures products is very high. Once the market fluctuates drastically, there will be a risk of forced liquidation, which may further increase the cost of hedging, which is not cost-effective for miners.

&amp;#x200B;

**In contrast, BHEX‚Äôs bitcoin options are clearly a better choice. Once the miner buys the put option, assume the price of the cryptocurrency falls, the gain from the payment of the option settlement or the increase in the price of the option can make up for the loss in the spot market. Even if the price of the cryptocurrency rises, only a small portion of the premium for the purchase of the option will be lost, the input cost will be smaller, and the capital occupancy rate will be greatly reduced.**

&amp;#x200B;

The same hedging operation, the choice of tools is critical. Compared with futures contracts, BHEX Bitcoin options products adopt a spread option strategy, which is cheaper to issue and has no risk of forced liquidation. It is a cost-effective and safer hedging tool for miners.

"Economics majors of Reddit, what was your first Job out of college?

Hi there,

Im a recent graduate (2020), with a degree in Economics. I‚Äôm basically wondering what career paths some of you have taken. I have internship experience as a credit analyst, however, I‚Äôm unsure of whether or not I want to continue down that path. I‚Äôve been sending out resumes and cover letters to Employers (probably 150-200 total), with barely any results (a few phone screens/prelim interviews). I always have heard that Econ majors are in high demand, I‚Äôm just curious as to what fields have this demand, as I‚Äôm having trouble landing a job. Covid can‚Äôt be helping that situation, but I feel as though with the classes I‚Äôve taken/internship experience, I should be having better luck. 

Thanks so much.","NO"

I have a High School Diploma, I have an Associate's Degree, I have a Bachelor's in Political Science, and am one semester away from a Bachelor's in English.  I then plan to attend Law School.

However, I have only had one job in my life.  I worked for a movie theater for six months back in 2006-2007.  That was my only work experience.  That plan seemed to have backfired, as it turns out.  

I received my Bachelor's in PoliSci this year, and now I am looking for a summer job to hold me off until I go back to school in the Fall.  I have one semester of college left, then take a break for the Spring semester until Law School in the following Fall.  Since I will have time off, I am finally looking for a job.  Just something part-time, nothing too extravagant.  So what do I do?  I go to snagajob and apply for a job at Dunkin Donuts.  Then, to my surprise, even with all my degrees, they flat out reject my application before a real human being ever even looks at it.  I do not meet their qualifications, whatever the hell that means (lack of work experience I'd venture to guess).

"Standard deviation from an opened file

*UPDATE: so the problem is that I have no clue how to convert the file to a list of integers - without the X45u value. If I were to be able to do that, my problems would be solved!*


So I have a question on an assignment that asks to create a file with certain values and then open the file in python. I have done that. One of the values is X45u.  I was asked to have my program take the average and standard deviation of the values from the file ignoring the invalid value. I was able to do it with minimal difficulty for finding the average. However, finding the standard deviation is proving difficult.

Earlier in the assignment, we were asked to create functions for average and standard deviation. I did those and both of those functions work. However, they work for lists and not this file. It is heavily implied we should use these functions or modify them for this. 

I tried to convert the file to a list, but when I do that, I end up with the values with \n attached to them and it just doesn‚Äôt work for my old standard deviation function. Additionally, when I try to just write it out with different variables for example, 

top= sum((x - mean)**2) 
bot = length -1
stdev = math.sqrt(top/bot)

I get an error saying that floats cannot be iterated. Because in order to get rid of the bad value I used a try-except statement and in order to have a length I had a variable count and yeah I can‚Äôt really explain this well at all... anyway...
I have been able to find equations that will print out some value, but I know it‚Äôs not the correct standard deviation because I‚Äôve already checked what that is.

"Towel color/stain suggestions?

When my boyfriend and I first started hosting, we were advised by a few people to supply all white towels, washcloths, bed linens, etc. for our guests so that they could all be washed together and could be easily bleached as needed.  This seemed like a good idea, but I'm learning that 1. People are disgusting and 2. The stains do not always come out in the wash, even with bleach.  Have any of you had experience with lighter and darker towels/linens? Do you have a preference? I'm thinking maybe if we switch to a darker color, the stains will at least be more hidden than on white where they really stand out. Thoughts? Below is an example of the stains I'm talking about. Like, I'm concerned about what kind of showers a person is taking if they are still this dirty when they get out and dry off.

"My (24M at the time) pee play road trip

Many years ago, I was active of Fetlife. That website was paradise for me as it was the first place that I connected with other people who love piss as much as I do. I made friends with a few women online, but there was one in particular (23F) that I had an ongoing virtual daddy/daughter dynamic with for a couple of years. We clicked so well in terms of our mentalities around the kink -pee was both of our first loves, and we both viewed it as something intimate and special instead of degrading. ‚ÄúPee is the new cum,‚Äù as they say. But she lived quite far, so our relationship seemed like it would be purely virtual. 

Well, about 10 years ago, my friends decide to organize a group vacation. The destination is borderline driveable for me, so I decide I‚Äôll make it a road trip. And it just so happens that the route took me through where my virtual pee pal lived. We decided it was time to finally meet face to face. 

There was maybe 4 minutes of awkward ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre real‚Äù followed immediately by being unable to keep our hands off of each other. But her roommates were home in her apartment, so what were we to do? Well, she happened to have a wooded area not too far from the building that we wandered over to. In broad daylight, in the middle of the afternoon, close enough to a group of people that we could hear their voices as we did this, she squats down and pulls my shorts down. I‚Äôve never gotten so hard so quickly from being sucked, but my god, her lips were magical. While holding my penis like a faucet, she goes off to the side and asks for a drink. I start peeing, and she SIPS MY STREAM LIKE A DRINKING FOUNTAIN. This was something I had been waiting my whole life to do, and she was as talented as she could have been at it. After I emptied, she sucked me for another like 10 seconds, which was all it took before I overflowed her mouth with my cum, and she of course swallowed that as well. 

I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better first golden shower to give, unless we could‚Äôve gotten her roommates to fuck off so we could have taken our time with it. I didn‚Äôt see her again, but on my drive home from the trip, I made a rule to never pee in a toilet. My car was completely saturated with piss by the end of it, but my god was it fun. Maybe that part of my drive will be my next confession :)","YES"

"What if Natasha's been Queen Veranke all this time?

I mean there's no evidence or anything of this but if they are doing Secret Invasion, there has to be a Skrull infiltrator, right?  And they're going to have to make the Black Widow movie something people are going to WANT to watch.  It's Phase 4 and takes place after Avengers 4, so we know Natasha stays on and survives.  Perhaps by making BW a villain and a Skrull queen, it'll give Scarlett something new and fun to work with as she continues her stint in the MCU.

In the animated show, the infiltrator was Cap but in the MCU the big heroes with all their beloved movies can't be tainted by making them a Skrull impostor, plus a Skrull wouldn't be able to replicate Thor's power or Tony's genius or the super abilities of any of the others for instance so that leaves only Rhodey, Natasha and Clint.  

Clint has human children (I assume) and eventhough Rhodey who has displayed shape-shifting abilities in the past would make sense, I like the idea of the MCU's closest parallel to Spider-Woman (a shady SHIELD agent with a shadowy past) Black Widow being the perfect pick for the Queen of the Skrulls to impersonate.  *in the comics the Skrull Queen posed as Jessica Drew for years and manipulated various events and situations thus laying the ground work for Secret Invasion*

Natasha doesn't have any abilities other than seemingly superhuman strenght and agility, for someone who is alledgedly just human.  The only problem with Natasha is that Wanda saw her past memories so that's a problem (she didn't see Clint or Rhodey's memories though).  Having Natasha double cross the team would also be very in keeping with her Ultimates counterpart and her tricking Fury, who may or may not have lost an eye to a Skrull, for so many years would be an extra sharp knife in the ribs to him.","NO"

"did i lose myself to my trauma? how do i get my old self back or can i at all?

so i‚Äôm a senior in high school and i faced the hardest moment of my life during the beginning of my junior year and i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs considered to b trauma but it did change me a lot. for a long time i solely thought the experience made me stronger, it gave me new perspective, obviously it sucked but i‚Äôm a half glass full type of person. so it definitely made me more of a bad bitch to sum it up i dropped a lot of toxic ppl stayed away from my ex and anything that radiated negative energy to me. i stopped giving my all cause i believed i didnt have ppl in my life who deserve it and i‚Äôm the only person who has my back. obv a lil flawed now that i‚Äôm thinking ab it. anyways last night i was on a call w my friend for 5 hrs just talking ab life and all these things came up and i realized that my personality was stripped from me because of what i went through. i thought ab it the whole day today on how bright and funny and bubbly i was and now i‚Äôm reserved, very calm and unbothered. of course there is nothing wrong w who i am now but i hate to realize how that part of me was stripped from me. and i think i wanted to get the person i was before back. i caught myself doing the dumbest thing ever. i impulsively followed my ex back and randomly hit up a friend who i stopped talking to because of the whole negative energy thing. ik doing those things won‚Äôt get my personality back but they were ppl who were in my life when i was a bubbly person. sometimes i think i was just naive bc i didn‚Äôt know these were negative ppl and i was surrounding myself w negative energy until i faced probably my lowest point in my life. anyways before i had this realization when all these ppl were out of my life i was in a lot more peaceful state. so idk why but i‚Äôm just so sad and i wanna get my old self back but as cliche as it sounds i honestly think she‚Äôs gone. what do ygs think? can anyone lend some advice; ik this was long and prob worded weird. this whole thing feels like a huge step back when for around 2 years i was building myself up to be someone who doesn‚Äôt bring back negative energy into her life anymore and not b bothered by bitches who don‚Äôt deserve it. okay this is turning into a rant. but yeah plz comment :)","NO"

"Just tripped for the first time last night

I‚Äôve been struggling mentally for a while and been extremely suicidal and all that, just in a super negative space. I had an opportunity to try shrooms and I felt like it was right and that the opportunity came to me. I tried 2.8g of penis envy shrooms, that was the best decision I‚Äôve made so far. I was with 2 friends I trust and tripped at their place. I don‚Äôt think I could ever describe how I felt, but everything felt so clear and I saw everything so differently. Like I saw everything as an empathetic person. It was like my mind was it‚Äôs own conscious and my body was just a vessel on this earth. I cried thinking about my life, what I‚Äôm doing and the circumstances I‚Äôm in. I thought about all the choices I‚Äôve made and instead of feeling angry towards my parents and family, I just felt sad and saw them as people not just my family. The whole trip wasn‚Äôt fun, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it was bad. It was just really emotional and opened up my views on things. It didn‚Äôt heal everything that I‚Äôve been dealing with and I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to, but it‚Äôs a start and I really needed those change of views. For once I feel a little less scared of living, and everything feels a bit more beautiful. I feel a little more human than monster, and I like my smile more. I think I‚Äôm a little prettier than I thought I was. I‚Äôm really happy I did it.","YES"

"Do Americans just not care about Americans dying?

Americans die from no healthcare, nothing is done to change that. Americans die from gun violence, nothing is done to change it. Americans die from opioid epidemic, nothing is done to change that. Is it surprising that we don‚Äôt care about covid deaths and our government lets us die? We‚Äôve been trained to accept people dying preventable deaths for the economy our entire lives. Other countries make commercials about helping hungry Americans while we deny and ignore our issues. 

Other countries are more concerned with the well-being of Americans than Americans themselves. We deny and ignore every crisis that kills us or ruins our people‚Äôs quality of life. If you speak about gun, covid, or lack of healthcare deaths, you‚Äôre mocked by your fellow citizens and even government. People die driving on ice to make it to their jobs because a non-essential business refuses to close for one day to protect its employees, while state services and buildings close and put out ‚Äúdo not drive on roads‚Äù warnings. 

Are we just desensitized to death? Why do so many Americans not care? 

I‚Äôm sorry if this is the wrong sub but I feel like anywhere I go, I‚Äôll probably get attacked by chuds who think we should die for their Big Mac, or centrists who say ‚Äúonly fat people will die.‚Äù","YES"
"[PARTIALLY LOST] King Of The Loveless - InfinityP

I am looking for an old, deleted video/song from a deleted youtube channel! 
[[I was not sure whether to mark this partially or fully lost, because other info exists but the video itself is fully lost, so sorry if I've marked it wrong!]]

The song/video I'm trying to find is ""King Of The Loveless"" by ""InfinityP"" (aka KingInfinitium)
It used the voicebank/vocalist Dex, and was part of a series called ""Kronos*Chronicles""
The youtube video had less than 1k views, so I'm doubtful anyone's downloaded it, but I'm hoping somehow with the links I have it could possibly be retrieved, or some level of further info surrounding it can be found (for example, other archives of the video even if they're broken)

There's two versions of the video, the original and the remake, both deleted (As well as all of the artist's other videos and social medias)
The original was posted on 12/31/16, the remake on 3/3/17


TL;DR: 2017 Vocaloid song, Artist suddenly vanished off web, want to find video

"Doom III BFG VR - Why did I wait?

This is by far the best VR game I‚Äôve played (with the mod). The modding put me off as I‚Äôm a couch gamer but as it was ¬£3.50 in the sale I thought I spend some time setting it up. 

The amount of settings is amazing too. I could really tailor it to how I wanted, eventually settling on a torch in one hand and the gun in the other with touch pad locomotion. 

So much fun to walk around probably the scariest thing I‚Äôve played, not because of the game per se but being right there with the noises and monsters. 

The 2 handed minigun I just held by my side and pretended it was heavy and I had to hold it low. Made me comfortable that I don‚Äôt care if Fallout and other games allow 1 handed big guns. I can just fake it. 

I also like the aiming options. I settled on a red dot rather than a laser. Was a fantastic aiming option. I like iron sites but a red dot really helps.

From today's trailer and press kit we found out that both the new Exotic head of Hunter and the Exotic boots of Titan give armor to the wielder. Also, in the trailers we can clearly see that both Hunter and Titan get a green aura(like void overshield aura) when they use their exotics so it seems like the green aura effect will give some kind of armor (or damage resist) to the player. That means that one of Strand's buffs gives armor and its probably the reason why T10 Resistance has been nerfed. What are your thoughts?

"M√∂gliches neues Mitglied der Str√∂hh√ºte

Ich glaube das ein neues Mitglied der Strohh√ºte Monet sein wird. Ich wei√ü sie ist b√∂se aber es deuten viele Sachen darauf hin. 1. Oft wenn man sie sah, lag im Hintergrund ein Buch auf dem Astronomie stand und ein Buch auf dem Eclipse, also Sonnenfinsternis stand. Daraus schlie√üt man das sie sehr am Weltall interessiert ist. Und was steht auf dem Schiff der Strohh√ºte ein Teleskop. F√ºr wen ist das Teleskop, niemand sonst hat es bis jetzt benutzt aber es wird nicht ohne Grund da sein. Es wurde also anscheinend f√ºr einen Astronomen der Strohh√ºte gemacht. Au√üerdem ist es eigentlich schon sicher das das Weltall eine wichtige Rolle spielen wird.
2. Auf Punk Hazard hat sie Chopper geholfen damit er die Kinder rettet. Die Kinder auf Punk Hazard waren ihr ja sehr wichtig. Dies beweist das sie nicht komplett b√∂se ist.
3. Ihr Herz wurde zwar von Caesar erstochen aber man konnte erkennen das er es nicht komplett durchstochen hat weil er ja ohnm√§chtig wurde. Daher wurde Monet nicht get√∂tet sonder ebenfalls bewusstlos. Und als die Strohh√ºte Caesar mitnahmen hat Chopper ihr Herz neben Caesar gefunden und es mitgenommen und vielleicht auch verarztet. Nun denken viele das sie durch die Explosion gestorben sei aber Block C in dem sie war wurde nie komplett zerst√∂rt gezeigt.
4. Der gr√∂√üte Contrapunkt ist wahrscheinlich das sie Doflamingo 100% treu ist. Hier kann man nur spekulieren aber ich denke, das Sugar Doflamingo in ein Spielzeug verwandeln wird damit er nicht festgenommen wird. Dadurch verlieren alle ihre Erinnerungen an ihn und somit auch Monet. Deswegen kann sie sich ohne bedenken anschlie√üen. 
5. Nico Robin war genau wie Monet eine von den B√∂sen und hat versucht die Strohh√ºte zu t√∂ten. Aber als sie mitmachen wollte haben sie sie aufgenommen.
6. Auf einem Cover, wei√ü nicht mehr genau welches, sah man die Strohh√ºte zusammen im Schnee spielen. Schnee? Monets Logiafrucht oder? Au√üerdem bauten sie einen Schneemann der Monet verd√§chtig √§hnlich sah und sie lachen alle und haben Spa√ü. Der ""Monet"" Schneemann lacht auch.

Zwar nur ne Theorie aber durchaus m√∂glich. Monets Traum k√∂nnte z.b sein auf alle 6 Monde der One Piece Erde zu Reisen. Somit h√§tte sie wie alle aus der Crew einen Traum.

"Venting an odd shaped room(not sealed) - advice please

Sorry to be a little winded, but if you make it to the end, i send my gratitude. Big project in the works and im sure I will have more questions over time. Looking for some advice from folks who have much more experience than myself.

I have an odd shaped room that I am trying to vent. Due to the layout of my house, having two rooms for veg and flower doesn't quite work. (ive been trying with tents, space issues and controlling two different humidity/temps isnt in the cards right now) so my option now is to build one large room and use it for a whole lotta fun!The space that I am trying to vent is 8' (left to right) 6' (front to back) 7' (tall) now... where it gets fun, to the left of this space i have another section that is an additional 6' (left to right) 5' (front to back) but **only 4.5' tall!**

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions are;

do i vent the space as one entire room with a single large exhaust?

Do I vent each section as if it were its own since the heat will rise differently in each space? I was planning on having fans blowing air from the small section toward the large section if this would help.

From my research, it would also be advisable to run an active intake with this size of a room. Would piping an active intake into the small space and have the exhaust come out the large room at the opposite end eliminate the need to ""dual vent"" or would i be best doing both, dual vent and active intake?

normally when using a passive intake you would want your intake to be twice the size of your exhaust, would using an active intake eliminate the need for this? could i say, just run a single active intake in the entire setup? (while still maintaining negative pressure)

&amp;#x200B;

to make things even more interesting i will be looking at having about 18-20 feet of ducting, im planning on using rigid for as much of it as possible and flexy bits in spaces that require any sort of curve so i can swoop instead of doing 90 degree bends

I currently have two 6"" vortex s-line fans (347cfm) from my old setup. i dont feel that these will be enough to do both rooms (i had them on max in a 3x3x6 space w/flexy piping)

My current ideas running in my head are

dual vent with two 6"" exhaust with passive vents

dual vent with an 8"" and a 6"" with passive vents

same as above but 6"" active vent

if you have made it this far, you are a god. thank you. i look forward to being schooled.","NO"

"Is anyone using the shop they give you at the trade depot? I haven't used it at all and don't see any reason to. (Also question about shipping for reputation).

At this point, in the end of Winter, I think I have 4 traders unlocked and there's never a day that one of them isn't in town. I also only ship one item each day to increase reputation with the rivals, and I save all of my items for conquests. I almost have all of the fields though, so once I have them I'll probably sell all the extra fodder I've saved up and all the gold linen instead of hoarding it. 

Is there something that unlocks by selling a certain number of items through your own shop? If not, what is the point of it? 

Also my question regarding shipping for reputation- am I supposed to be shipping one item to EACH trader or just one item per day? I think I read that you get 10 rep points with all the rivals every day that you ship at least one item, but wasn't sure if you also get points with the traders which will then unlock something else?","NO"

"Norman frets over $36

It had been weeks. Norman checked his mailbox every day, and each day there was no check. The first few weeks he decided the holidays were responsible for the delay. Once the holidays passed he decided to wait until after the first pay cycle.  After the second pay cycle passed with no check, he was getting frustrated. 

In early December he had been chosen among several others in his department to attend a two day conference for work.  The arrangement included reimbursement for hotel costs.  He was excited for the opportunity. Employees were allowed to book their own room with an allowance of fifty dollars per person. Fifty dollars seemed extravagant to Norman. He wanted to prove he was frugal and responsible, so he chose the least expensive hotel he could find, even though it was an hour's train ride from the conference center.  

On the car pool ride to the event, Norman got to sit next to Lisa for two and a half hours. He wished he'd brought a book so he would have something to cover his inability to think of anything to say for most of the trip, but he enjoyed sitting next to her anyway.

When they returned to work, he dutifully submitted a reimbursement form for thirty-six dollars with the receipt from the hotel. The form stated he should expect a check in the mail within 10 business days. It had been weeks. He debated sending an email to the Accounts Payable department. They were probably busy. He didn't want to bother them. It may not be their fault at all. Maybe there was a problem at the post office. However, not having that money meant he didn't get to keep his bi-weekly tradition of taking himself out to dinner and he felt like he had earned it after an especially challenging month at work. 

Norman stared into his empty mailbox for several minutes. He closed it with a sigh. Maybe he'd give it one more week. He didn't want to be a complainer.","NO"

"Trying to force Arch not to use vfio gpu even earlier than initramfs (modprobe config)

So I have what my msi mobo sees as the primary gpu set to be used as the passthrough gpu in the modprobe config. The issue is prior to running startx (I login in the initial cli and then run \`startx\` to get to my desktop) there is no gpu output from the host gpu. I can do it all by muscle memory and get to the desktop but there is no monitor output from my host card and a frozen output from the passhtrough card until startx is run and I enter the desktop. It seems Arch is trying to use a gpu that is no longer there until I run startx.

Is there some sort of xorg config I am missing to just make arch not even try to use the passthrough gpu even in the initial readout and cli right after boot but prior to startx. Or do I need to use something even earlier than where the modprobe config gets picked up to ensure I see all the initial cli output and prompts?

Or am I thinking in the wrong way and since my passthrough gpu is AMD I can actually just turn it off right as I enter desktop on my host without any issues when it is passed through on vm boot?

Just in case this is an important factor, I have an encrypted drive so right now I have to enter a passphrase before anything else. Can't see that prompt either of course.","NO"

But I always tried to get up and start a new day. I‚Äôm in my self developing state for years now, maybe 2 or more. But I can‚Äôt consider my self near to what I want.  


I have tried learning new things, reading new books, watching self-development videos, journaling, waking up early, avoiding distractions, avoiding distractions, overcoming bad habits, overcoming depression and anxiety, and a ton of things. And every time I failed, but always tried again and I‚Äôm trying now too! I‚Äôm just a teen who wants to be always a teen.

But the first time I‚Äôm trying vigorously to be on that position what I want. There are a few things why I‚Äôm trying vigorously.

* I‚Äôm trying for a competitive exam which I have failed last year.
* I‚Äôm not in depression now so It‚Äôs easier to cope with failure.
* I‚Äôm also in my comfort zone ( home ) where I wasn‚Äôt for last year.
* I want to share my experience with at least a few of you!

There are lots of things and a lot of stories to tell, but Yes I‚Äôll tell you gradually. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm gonna fail at this as always but I surely know I‚Äôm gonna try.

"Annie's motivation? [Manga Spoilers]

Considering all the things that happened in the manga, I still can't make heads or tails of what she is thinking. Here are the big questions I can't figure out: 

Why did she kill the two captured titans Hanji was researching? 

Why did she apologize to the corpse of one of her comrades?

If she seemed sad about the death of one of her comrades, why did she so mercilessly kill all those soldiers while trying to capture Eren?

And since she killed all those other soldiers, why didn't she kill Armin?

She seems to not care about what happens to humanity, yet she still seems to have some humanity in herself. She seems to be suffering the same way Bertolt is. Does anyone have any speculations regarding Annie's (also Bertolt's and Reiner's) motivations behind their ""mission?""","NO"

I read on CNN's website yesterday, that CVS and Rite Aid are limiting purchases of Plan B to 3 at a time.

Did they change writers / staff or just take the handcuffs off them (""hey do another episode where they ALMOST capture grievous!"") or something?

    Yeah. I got the distinct impression Christie would be up everyone's ass
    with a microscope monitoring *everything* on all Americans. He's given
    the impression up here that the Bill of Rights is outdated and needs to
    be repealed completely (remember, I live in NYC now and we see a lot
    more of Christie than we would ever care to).
    
    To change the subject, I *loved* Trump's comment on having bought
    politicians. He appeared to be trying to say he was the only one above
    such since he didn't need money from PAC's.

    At Blue Cross, you get a shift differential.  It?s generally $2 per hour more than the first shifters get.  You also get all the overtime you could want, at time and a half.  For example, there are two positions needed on third right now.  While the other one is vacant, you will have an opportunity to get some OT.  Also, on occasion, someone on second shift wants a day off, and generally someone from first will take half, and someone from third will take the other half.

"Question about a workstation for deep learning with dual GPUs

I am looking at getting a machine for some personal research. I have funding that will run out if I don't spend it, so cloud credits aren't as good an idea as actually getting a workstation. I have looked at a couple workstations, both at about $8k, and I'm trying to decide between them. I don't want to build my own (not sure I'm even allowed to using my funding). Both include a nice warranty, an Intel core i9 13900k CPU, loads of RAM, and a couple m.2 SSDs. The Exxact machine has a pair of RTX 3090s with nvlink and the build a salesperson helped me with at Microcenter has a pair of a4500s. I know the CUDA core count is higher in the former but the latter requires less power and can run longer. Both setups have enough VRAM for anything I'd throw at them. 

On paper the 2x 3090 build is more powerful. But for running something in my own home for scientific computing and some personal deep learning projects, which is the better choice?

edit: Looked again and the Exxact box at $8k is actually a single 4090. Dual 3090s are closer to $9k.","NO"

i feel like the relationship between Xander and Evvie was always really blurry, but maybe this is me just misinterpreting the edit.

"[Misc] - Paula's Choice boosters just got new packaging, do they remind anyone else of another brand? XD

I've never bought Drunk Elephant before but that's the first thing that came to mind when I saw them haha. Anyone else? 

While I like the old packaging, I'm glad they're trying to update it, though this isn't the route I would've gone. For some reason I can't place, it actually looks cheaper to me, like cosmetics for kids, though I'm no expert on what's popular or trendy these days either...

"Hi Can I please get your attention for 2 min for a vital case ?

I am writing this text using a stick that is placed in my mouth as I can‚Äôt use my hands for the past 10 years and I have a vital case to tell you about if you spare me only 2 minutes to read this. I‚Äôm a 28 years old guy who has been living last 10 years as a disabled person as a result of a car accident which caused me to end up being paralyzed from the neck downwards when I was 18 years old and studying at university. Without getting help from my parents I am not able to eat or drink, nor scratch my head when it feels itchy. Since then, I‚Äôve been in need for at least one or two people to meet my daily routine work. I can‚Äôt express myself enough to tell you how tiring this is, not only for me but for my parents too as they‚Äôre getting older and weaker. While I was thinking as to what I could do in order to bring a solution to this case so that I could be able to look after myself in the absence of my parents, I came across to a treatment under the name of ‚ÄòEpidural Stimulation Implant‚Äô which promises to give patients those body functions back that‚Äôs been lost previously. The treatment is carried out in a hospital located in Thailand. However the cost of this treatment is significantly higher than what my parents can handle. Therefore I am looking for a sponsor to support me throughout this journey. I‚Äôve put the web link up above in case you may want to read about the treatment. I will be waiting for your response to this mail either positive or negative it will make me happy friends. Kind Regards.

Yes, you heard that right. BUSD right to your wallet. No staking, just right to your wallet. This is the first of its kind.

‚ö°Ô∏è 4-8% BUYBACK

On every buy/sell/transfer 4-8% is taken for Zeus to buy back and burn tokens. This has resulted in a 17% burn IN ONE WEEK.

‚ö°Ô∏è 4% DINAMIC LIQUIDITY POOL

Anytime the liquidity percentage is higher than 25%, this tax flows instead to Zeus as further tribute, making him even stronger. Personally, I think this will be cloned all over BSC. It's brillant.

Qualifying Condition: During the 7 days of the Btok Olympics, all buys of $BULLDOG equal to at least 10BNB in value will award you a ticket entry into this competition to win a huge prize. Any selling of $BULLDOG during this period will disqualify the wallet from eligibility to win anything.

they know im depressed, I've dropped enough hints for them to know that im trans or at least questioning it, ive said many times that im tired of feeling fucking lonely all the time and that i want to do something, but do they do anything? no. do they put any effort into making me happy? no. 

all i want is for one person to hug me and tell me everything is gonna be ok, for them to spend one day of their life (which sounds reasonable, because, unlike me, they get to enjoy every other day) trying to make me happy, to get everyone i like in a room just to hug me or something, show that they care.

fuck, is that too much too ask?

but all they do is say ""everyone would be sad if you died, we care about you, you can talk to me if you want"" and that doesn't fucking help, im tired of it, it really feels like they dont really care about me and just say that because of a moral obligation or something. i get it its hard to deal with depressed people and i know its mostly my fault and they just want to help but dont know how but fuck, you've known me for 15 years, is it really that hard to know what makes me happy? i guess it is. all i need is a little bit of dedication from them but i guess i dont get to ask that because ""i don't want to be helped""

"This is only 'moderate'?

I've been through hell with my depression for the last 6 months. Every single day I have managed to get up, showered and dressed, and a lot of days that has been a real effort and all I have managed. I can't cook, I have no interest in anything, I have very little concentration, I am so fatigued and tired all the time but yet I can't sleep at night. I cry a lot and I have felt emotionally worse than I ever would have thought possible. I physically hurt some of the time and the world in totally overwhelming. I have self harmed several times, and I really hoped I had got over that years ago. I have felt so indescribably terrible that its felt like I am being physically choked by the blackness, like I need to scream, to run, to do something but I can't because it is paralysing. I cannot describe to anyone how I have felt because there are no words for it, at least not that I can find. I have been signed off work for months, developed social anxiety issues, and struggle to leave the house. I have given thought to suicide but not wanted to do it; I'm still getting over losing my dad to cancer several years ago and I couldn't put my family through another death, even just mine. 

Through my work, I have private health insurance that has enabled me to get counselling and to see a psychiatrist (I'm in the UK). The last few days I have been feeling a bit brighter, although I don't dare think that will last. Today I received a report from my psychiatrist that my company has requested, about how I'm doing etc. The psychiatrist has sent it to me to review and to send on if I am happy with it. In it, she gives my current state as 'moderate depression'. 

Moderate? Really? What the fuck is severe then? Would that have been if I hadn't got control of myself with that knife in my hand and kept going, as I wanted to, to my wrists?

I am really thrown by this. The psychiatrist is a professional with a lot of experience so I feel she must be right. But have I really gone through all this with just moderate depression? I feel like I am weak and pathetic not to have coped better with this, I should have pushed on and just carried on. I already felt bad about taking time off, now I feel terrified about when I do go back to work. Im going to be seen as a weakling, as work shy or as a hypochondriac for taking so much time for a moderate condition. I know my colleagues won't know but I don't know if my boss will see the report. I feel like a complete failure again, and I'm hating myself for that too because its not even severe. I'm thoroughly ashamed of myself and disgusted at the mess I've made of everything. I just don't know what to do now.

Part of me really wants to cut myself up badly, to make a point about how bad I feel, something that can be seen. But that's attention seeking and I absolutely hate that. And then ppl other than professionals might learn about the cutting and I really don't want that.

I'm a mess, and a failure and a weakling and its all my own fault for not being stronger. I hate myself.","YES"

"Vive screen stays black upon starting SteamVR; Display Mirror doesn't show anything, VR games start and are displayed on main monitor, but have tremendous lag and don't track

The last time I used my Vive was about a week ago, and everything worked perfectly fine. Today, I wanted to finally play some ""ordinary"" games in VR using VorpX, but my Vive just won't turn its screen on when I start SteamVR.

The LED on the side of the HMD is green, and so are all status indicators in the SteamVR window. ""The headset is connected and tracking"". However, I don't get anything displayed on my HMD. What makes me think that this is a software issue is that my [Display Mirror also shows nothing at all](http://i.imgur.com/IjfVuqX.png), stays completely white, and bugs out [if I switch to single-eye mode](http://i.imgur.com/K8mg0BE.png).

Launching VR games from the Steam desktop UI works - I've tried The Lab and it displays video on the little 2D view window it opens, but it took quite a while to initialize and played at *terrible* frame rates - this happens for *all* VR apps, including room setup and the tutorial. Also, tracking doesn't work properly (read: at all). VR Display Mirror continues to stay blank and/or glitch out.

Last time I've had this issue, I was able to fix it by rebooting the Vive and then my computer. This time around, the issue is more persistent than that - I've tried rebooting both devices multiple times, I've uninstalled and then reinstalled all USB drivers through the developer menu, I've tried different USB ports and hooking the HMD up directly to my computer - all to no avail.

Has anyone else had this issue? Does anyone know how to solve it? I'd really love to continue using my Vive.

I am seeing a girl [22F] for about 3 months now. We have an amazing chemistry and we can talk forever. I really love spending time with her more than anything else. I think about her every hour of the day and I am crazy about this girl. 

2 weeks ago on our last date she told me she really liked me back. There is one big problem however. My crush has a deep fear of commitment. She recently ended a 5 year long relationship and she said that she haves the desire to be ""free"" and to ""just have fun"". 

This is fine. I would like to be exclusive but it is not a necessary. The problem however is that she really holds herself back. She represses her feelings for me by not talking or seeing me for minimally a week or two. When she is cooled down we meet up again and the whole thing starts over. I really miss her in the meantime, but I also want to give her the space she needs. I don't want to push her or make her feel uncomfortable but at the same time I would love to see her more often than once in 2 weeks.

Details:

It was on a website so not on a handheld console

Virtual world where you can choose what creature you want to be (i think like dog or wolf or bird something like that)

Cute style - not too cutesy tho

Involved lots and lots of quests where you can level up you magic

I remember one area of the world was like haunted bog or something like that

There was a mine where you could ""dig"" for precious stones

There was another area that was like a pirate's ship

Can talk and make friends with other players

"The many riddles of fashion

Why is Pearl Hairpin not under Pin? Why isn't Moonlight Serenade under Scarf? Why is Brooch made of items that could fit under Handheld, Scarf and Wing? Why aren't socks/tights and things that fit over them given separate categories?

Why do we require ""material"" for dying clothes, but not for actually making them? Really, crafting systems in most videogames have rather weak ties to the real thing, but this one seems to have none whatsoever.

Why are players only given 2-4 slots to save outfits in a game made for dressing up? World of Warcraft allows indefinite slots.

What designer would make a breastplate, greaves and gauntlets that look perfectly respectable even if not realistic as armour, and then place under them an unarmoured, ridiculously revealing dress with underwear showing? I would never have thought they went together if I hadn't seen the set.

I don't mind a game having a contrived, implausible setting to justify mechanics, but why does this one have *two*, and forget the first before the game properly begins? And it's supposed to be a constructed world, yet they refer to British and Chinese styles in dialogue.

Why don't we have something as simple as a way to review how much we scored on each trait? Or to get to incomplete sets without scrolling all the way through a slow-loading list? Or just have a working search function on sets?

How fractured must the development team be to have fluent English voice actors but no competent translator or proofreader?

"Sub $3000 commuter car

Hey everyone, currently I'm driving a 2000 Chevy Blazer which I love but I now have much longer commutes for work and my personal life so the gas is starting to hurt my wallet. I've been looking for a cheap car that I could get better gas mileage with. I have no problems getting a stick shift or automatic. I normally do all the work on my cars so something like replacing a fuel pump isn't a big deal. Cars I've been considering so far have been, Late 90s Chevy Monte Carlos, Early 2000s Impalas/Malibus, Early Chevy Cobalts, most Saturn sedans, late 90s early 2000s oldsmobiles. I'd rather stay domestic with GM, Chrysler, or Ford but I understand you can pay the price of reliability. I'm aware that some corollas, camrys, civics, ect. Can be had in this price range, but they are all very high mileage or don't seem to have been taken care of.

I recently read an interesting rebuttal to Rand Paul's claims that free healthcare meant he would be forced to provide patients with care.  It brought up the point that the Bill of Rights decrees that a lawyer will be provided to everyone, along with the right to a trial, thus involving jurors, a judge, and lawyers.  It was an interesting point, and I struggled to come up with a counter argument.  So, my question for you more experienced libertarians, is how would you refute this?","NO"

#MORE INFORMATIONS (FUN FACTS):

#U-HAUL LESBIAN:

&gt;The U-Haul lesbian or U-Haul syndrome is a stereotype of lesbian relationships[1] referring to the idea that lesbians tend to move-in together after a short period of time (e.g., after the second date). It suggests an extreme inclination toward committed relationships. Depending on context, the term can be considered humorous, complimentary, or pejorative.[2][3]

&gt;Origin

&gt;A joke which references U-Haul (a brand of rental ""move-it-yourself"" trucks and trailers) became well known in lesbian culture.[4]

[...]

&gt;It is considered a staple of lesbian humor.[5] Often attributed to comic Lea DeLaria,[6][7] it is also possibly derived from Canadian lesbian advocate Krista Lush, who once noted of her relationships: ""one kiss, and they move in.""[citation needed]

&gt;Reference to a ""U-Haul"" later became a stereotype of sexual identity in the gay community.

üëâ Source: English ""Wikipedia"" page about ""U-Haul Lesbian"" at the following link: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-Haul_lesbian .


#RELATIONSHIP ESCALATOR X RELATIONSHIP LANDSCAPE:


&gt;Relationship Escalator: The concept of building a relationship ‚Äúupwards‚Äù toward certain goals such as co-habitation, marriage, procreation.

&gt;Often tied with mono-normative (above) ideals, the Relationship Escalator refers to the process of building a relationship upwards with different ‚Äústeps.‚Äù In traditional, mono-normative culture this may look like: dating first, then dating ‚Äúexclusively,‚Äù then co-habitation and/or joint investment (house, RV, etc.), then engagement &amp; marriage, then procreation. Following the Relationship Escalator is not mutually-exclusive with monogamy (and many ENM or poly people practice/desire a Relationship Escalator partnership), and it is not inherently a good or bad process but rather is a personal choice to each individual. 

&gt;Relationship Landscape: The concept of all relationships contributing to a person‚Äôs vast ‚Äúlandscape.‚Äù Thought to be the opposite of the ‚ÄúRelationship Escalator.‚Äù

&gt;In the Relationship Landscape there is no higher and lower and there are no goal-oriented ‚Äústeps‚Äù to take. This perspective offers a more flexible approach to relationship exploration and the directions of a relationship or series of relationships can vary.

[...]

&gt;There is a phase when adjusting to a non-monogamous lifestyle where a person will likely have to re-examine their implicit biases and beliefs about relationships and relationship structures. This phrase is used to depict the destruction of ownership-based ideologies, the Relationship Escalator, and other mono-typical beliefs as new ideals are integrated into a person‚Äôs relational lifestyle changes. 

&gt;This guide is actively updated with new terms and refined definitions. If you do not find a term on here, please send me an email and I will add it to the list!!

It doesn't make a lot of sense from a queue time/player retention standpoint to do anything but cherry pick out players who are struggling and give them an opportunity to have a 3 kill game or whatever.

Warzone has similar SBMM from the tests people have run. Average K/D of players tends to be the same in lobbies until you hit a specific potato breakpoint and then it gives you the BK lobby","NO"

The DMZ is meant to be an area segmented from your LAN, with the minimal possible number of ports open for what you need.  So even if any DMZ servers are compromised, the attacker isn't in your LAN.

"Old East (Bounded by Oxford, Dundas, Adelaide and Quebec - ish) is probably going to be your best value for money, and walking distance to downtown. I imagine you'd get a nice 1BR for under 900. 

A lot of nice apartments in the old Victorian houses in that neighborhood, and its cheap because people see at as a pretty sketchy area (though to be honest, its really not that bad).

If you want a step up, I would go for Woodfield (bounded by Oxford, Dundas, Adelaide and Richmond) . Closer to downtown, nicer neighbourhood, and the same beautiful Victorian homes. It'll be a little harder harder to find something under 900, but probably possible. It's where I live right now and I love it. Absolutely perfect neighbourhood in my book.

Congrats on the lawyer job, and welcome to London. I'm actually a law student working a summer job in Ottawa and returning to London for 3L and articles.

"Correct. But I would further this thought, if you allow, and say that aiming to be rewarded with happiness for putting in work outside of what directly makes you happy, or that aiming for happiness at all is irrational if that is the only thing one is concerned about.

If it annoys you that the world is hopeless, you can change it, but only for as much as your strength or wits allow. When you look closely, a lot of people have changed it for the worse out of spite, and they probably gave up on living the good life too. While they tried to somehow express their feelings of unhappiness so that ""somebody"" comes and saves them, you are currently more clear-headed and act with rational thought rather than frantic fulfillment of your inner subvocations.

"Ok so that answers that question...so here's my realistic response to your post now that I have that information:

You've had a hard time with your health and getting on your feet, which I assume is why it's been 4 years and you haven't taken much action.  The problem with this is that a judge (or should I say, your ex's lawyer) is going to ask why you have never bothered to see your son before now.  You'll explain your health issues, and then he will basically argue that if your health was keeping you from taking action for years, you're not fit to be a full time parent.  As harsh as that sounds, that will likely be his argument.  Even though the dad has been an ass to you, he hasn't actually broken any laws.  

Your more realistic goal should be to re-establish visitation rights with your son, and then re-incorporate yourself into his life.  In other words, you would first have to go to court to get access to your son, and then gradually demonstrate why you're a better full time parent.  It's definitely possible, but it's going to be arduous and expensive.  However, the judge is not going to just uproot your son's established life because you're 'ready' to be his mom.  That's not even likely if your son tells the judge he wants to live with you...judges don't let kids make those decisions (although they often take the child's desires into account.)

I've been in a similar place...I didn't know my daughter was mine until she was close to 2 years old.  I had full custody by the time she was 3, because her mom was not providing a safe environment (read: she was living with a sex offender) however if her mom had been doing her job as a mom, I probably would still only have visitation.  The whole thing cost me close to 15 grand, which included a custodial evaluation by a psychologist who recommended my daughter come live with me.

Your best bet is going to be to own up to your mistakes.  Acknowledge that you've been missing in your son's life, for whatever reason, and realize you're going to have to re-establish communication.  Sure, your ex is an ass, but he's not the only one who has made decisions that have left you where you're at right now.  The WORST thing you can do is to approach this the way that you are now...blaming, accusing, claiming that your ex is kidnapping (that's just simply a false accusation that could get you into trouble.  If you claim that he's a kidnapper and the police find and remove the child, only to find out you have no custody, you could get into serious, serious trouble, not to mention how bad it will look in family court.)

It's great that you've gotten your life together, but it's unlikely a judge is going to move your son's primary residence unless you can truly show that your son is better off with you, which is unfortunately a very expensive undertaking that could easily fail if your ex has a good lawyer.","NO"

I was in Kerala in the immediate aftermath of the floods. The waiting time for a half decent electrician to get to fix something was about 3 weeks, and people were willing to pay whatever it took....So it may make sense to get a few hardworking 12th standard pass kids and get them through some kind of trade school.

"&gt; Some thoughts on Anthony Martial: in terms of characteristics/role he's  something between a second striker &amp; a centre forward.

&gt;  Outstanding features: smart movement, excellent close control/touch (and overall technical ability), makes everything look simple

&gt; Very strong in 1v1 situations, obviously very quick/change of pace, surprisingly composed in front of goal for such a young player 

&gt; As a vague reference he can in some way be reminiscent of a young Thierry Henry (not the spitting image, but there are similarities)

&gt; On the flip side there are issues about consistency, ability to impose himself physically and possibly a certain lack of determination

&gt; As for the price, Monaco clearly believe Martial is to become a world beater in a 1-2 year perspective (many ""insiders"" seem to agree) 

&gt; So it's all about future projections &amp; pricing of potential. Could be worth 10 million in a year, could be worth 80 million...

"Hey, so I tried this, and I've come up with a list of annoying show-stopper problems I have with this:

1) Your syntax doesn't support calling a function returned from another function. All my fantasies about making block iterators fell apart. I was hoping to be able to (if i wanted) implement a traditional for loop with:

    my_for(start,end,step)(v =&gt;
        do_stuff().
    )

But, alas, your syntax doesn't support this for some reason..

2) Your array comprehensions only work on arrays. It would be nice if you could make generic generators a la python so I could do something like:

    for a in range (0, 100)

Currently your system does not support this sort of numeric iteration at all (beyond basic whiles) which is a massive oversight in my opinion. Yes, I could make a function range that produces an array of every integer from 0 to 100, but this would be very inefficient.

Also, real list comprehensions (i don't know python well so I'll use Haskell here) can draw from multiple lists, i.e

    [(x,y) | x &lt;- [0..3], y &lt;- [5..7]]

would produce:

    [(0,5),(0,6),(0,7),(1,5),(1,6),(1,7),(2,5),(2,6),(2,7),(3,5),(3,6),(3,7)]

Sadly, your array comprehensions appear to be far too limited for this sort of stuff.

Also, your period syntax is questionable, as is your use of : for defining variables. I would much rather = here, because i'm defining something to be = to something. On top of this, +: and so forth just seem weird.

If you use layout-sensitive blocking in future, be sure not to break cases like my block iterators above.

Finally, I found myself often encumbered by your interpretation of newlines as end-of-statement delimeters. I'm not sure what to do about it though, cos I hate semicolons too.","NO"

"Whm main here, and I agree with you. If you just play the class as you did, there's not really much change. Which is pretty disappointing actually, given that the big change mechanic is one that can be largely ignored. 

I've found that I can work in lilies into my healing planning. I prioritize Cure 2 until I have 3 lilies, then I start using Cure 1's until I use a skill that consumes the lilies. Then it's back to Cure 2's. I just don't feel it's that useful of a change, if you have to ignore other spells just for it to be useful. 

Confession however is just useless. That's a huge disappointment as our new level 70 mechanic. First you have to crit a heal, so low percentage chance. Then, only a 20% chance to get a stack. So, on the occasion where you do manage a crit, only one out of five of those will grant a stack. Essentially, our lvl 70 job mechanic is a lottery that doesn't really have any viable use, since we can't rely on it for any practical purpose.

"All it probably needs is a recap which should only cost $10-15 in parts along with an hour or two of labor, that $400 quote was probably just the repair man telling you they didn't want to do it. Recapping these old radios is actually pretty easy, you just have to have some basic soldering skills and take your time with each part.

The capacitors that need to be replaced are the large electrolytic ones as well as all of the paper capacitors. Looking at the schematic I can tell the electrolytic ones are C101(multi-part cap) and C201, the paper caps you'd have to identify.

This is an excellent guide for radio recapping and tells you everything you need to know about technique and identifying components. 

https://antiqueradio.org/recap.htm

Also when buying components I usually have this page open since old radio capacitors typically use nomenclature that's fallen out of favor, it'll help when looking for replacement parts on digi-key.

"I agree. It seems to be popular these days to write people off as toxic and ‚Äòcut them out‚Äô. I‚Äôm all for staying away from people who cause trouble, but from what I‚Äôve noticed, often when people do this, part of the problem is that they themselves have things that they need to work through - otherwise they will continue to have the kinds of relationships with those around them that they view as ‚Äòtoxic‚Äô. 

And like you, this isn‚Äôt a stab at OP. Many people are highly encouraging of the whole ‚Äòcutting out all the toxic people‚Äô thing without knowing the context of someone‚Äôs situation, whereas like you, I think it‚Äôs important to gain a clear understanding of what‚Äôs going on. Otherwise one may run the risk of developing further ‚Äòtoxic‚Äô relationships with people in the future.","NO"

But the point is that by hunting carnivore animals you decrease the suffering of the herbivore animals, like deers. That is the point, you are already minimizing suffering.

"MLB does a really good job of keeping interest in the offseason which may be my favorite part. It helps scratch that baseball itch in December. Plus the Diamond demos are just awesome.

NFL network does a good job but without the ability to do the live look-ins or have daily games to talk about they tend to have to stretch out a lot of storylines.

I can't stand NBA network, thats probably just a personal bias though. Plus they play WNBA and D-League games in the offseason. Nobody wants to see that.

"here's his thought process: pregnancy is not his problem. he thinks anyone he fucks is either on birth control or is going to ""take care of it"" through plan b or abortion. I can guarantee you he doesn't know what a menstrual cycle is, let alone that plan b doesn't work throughout. there's an entire subset of people who view abortion as birth control.

I have a feeling that, since HIV became manageable where drugs are available, it's not seen or represented as that much of a threat as it used to be, so ignorant jerks think of STDs as something that's a non issue/ can be taken care of with a round of antibiotics. if you're feeling up to it, ask him to name at least 5 STDs. my bet is he can't. 

also, women tend to have a more difficult time with STDs. for example, women are more likely to contract HIV from having sex with an infected person than men (ex. through genital lacerations which are more likely to happen if you have a vagina than if you have a penis). HPV is a lot more likely to cause cancer (ex. cervical) in women than in men, and HPV vaccination campaigns are often directed towards women rather than men (who are carriers all the same!). these things work together to make it easier for a guy who's a jerk to prioritize his pleasure over safety.","YES"

"Scenarios were fun, but gear inflation killed them.  Remember that the normal scenarios were designed for people in leveling gear, so around iLevel 425.  Heroic Scenarios were designed for about 480.  That means that, for the last year and a half, the majority of people have outgeared them within a week of hitting 90.

I really enjoyed them in 5.0.  They were like the old Elite Group quests.  Tough enough that you couldn't sleepwalk through them, but not so tough that you couldn't have fun with them.  I also enjoy that the 3-man limit made you think outside your class role sometimes.  If you had two healers and a DPS, the DPS is probably tanking.  Or maybe the healers ping-pong mobs back and forth so the DPS can concentrate on blowing them up.  The different compositions always meant you were doing something a little different this time.

Like most things in WoW, though, the gear hammer smashed them and made them unfun.  Unless people seriously enjoy touring level 90 Heroics filled with mobs that can't even scratch you.","NO"

"Nice post. I'm hesitant about direct agri-commodity exposure as la nina fades out, but I've been looking at some sidelong exposure:

There was a nice potash post from u/neversell69 which is related to this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/m4d7du/bull\_case\_for\_potash\_the\_unloved\_behemoth\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/m4d7du/bull_case_for_potash_the_unloved_behemoth_of_the/)

I've been hodling DE for almost a year now which also plays on agri as a whole plus forestry, I'm thinking it's getting toppish though as more and more people are piling in (buffet, cathie, gates) and it's being slowly mentioned in the media. I would like to switch to agco, but it just feels not as good to me.

I'm thinking of shifting into railroads (probably unp for it's china-port-of-call exposure + agri, but perhaps cp for it's \[maybe\] US-CA-MX line if the merger gets okayed -- see u/moistgocu [https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/mko2ja/playbook\_of\_the\_decade\_ch\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/mko2ja/playbook_of_the_decade_ch_2/)) to take some advantage of broad-spectrum agri commodity exposure plus factory goods.

"&gt;Make it free and say you have to get a degree within 10 years or else you'll have to pay all of it back makes a big difference. 

This is a genius idea. If we did that, things might improve!

The average time Norwegians spend on a 3-year bachelor's degree was 4,6 years a couple years ago when last I looked. Meaning for every person who actually completes on time, another one takes more than 6 years to get it done. A master's is even worse. It's completely normal here to be nearly 30 and have zero work experience.

&gt;Also, maybe the problem lies with employers, if they didn't set such a high bar then maybe people wouldn't study as long as they do.

Not really. When you get 100 fresh applicants and 30 of them have a master's degree, why waste time on the other 70? It's hard enough to process large volumes of applications as it is, so you're always happy to find a hard-facts way of sorting out the masses. Like ""do you have an advanced degree, Y/N""

&gt;You're assuming it's all based on just free tuition and that's that, whereas it seems like it's a far more complex issue, one that covers multiple parts of your society.

It is complex, and I recognize that. But free tuition, study till you're 40 on society's dime, is a big part of it. People not realizing there's no such thing as ""free"" is too.","NO"

"I've got two, one for my last job (which is better) and one for my current.

While working retail (at, let's call it Bulls Eye). Dude took the crown (powered pallet jack), and put a pallet loaded with cat litter up in the steel. A little janky of a set down, but nothing else goes next to it so it was fine. He then takes a pallet of water, and in his infinite wisdom... puts it on top of the pallet of cat litter. Uncentered.

It took about 30 seconds after he walked away for gravity to work its magic, but the weight of the water pulled the cat litter pallet towards the side and... down the whole thing came, about 15 feet. Wet cat dirt fucking *everywhere* and the *sound* when that thing hit... Fortunately no one was hurt. That dude got booted so hard I'm pretty sure a dudes ass randomly hurt over at Mal*Wart and he doesn't know why.

At my current job, working security, personal favorite is a new guy who hadn't been showing up for his overnights. Had accused me of lying when I said he didn't show up. Our boss actually *showed up* at one of the shifts he was supposed to be on with me, and called him saying I'd told him he wasn't on site. He told the manager he was there *right then* and didn't know what the fuck my problem was. While the manager was there. Boss said ""Well, I'm here next to him so you can ask him if you want"". Silence. ""Well?"". ""Fuck you!"" and hung up. Last we saw of him.","NO"

"I know most people won't see this but I wanted to give my take on it having worked in the [American] restaurant industry for 9 years now.  *In general* in America, there is kind of a certain expectation for everyone to be outwardly happy in certain situations like the server/patron relationship.  Again, in general, people that dine at sit down establishments come in wanting to enjoy themselves and feel as if the person waiting on them should at least pretend to be happy to do so or otherwise it would somehow diminish their experience.  Sadly, most of the industry is riddled with people that ARE pretending and it's kind of a thing that the general population expects but without thinking about it as a real requirement in the same as you, for example, expect the basics like correct orders, timeliness, and attentiveness.  I say basics because there are a handful of us that smile not just because it is American culture to do so (which we definitely do more than some other cultures) but because we genuinely care about you enjoying yourself and when I see that you are a smile doesn't appear on my face out of expectation but because I'm actually happy that I helped you enjoy yourself.  I say basics because to me that's what that is.  There are many people that are there for 'easy money' and fake it.  Those are the kind of people that basics become an expectation for.  In my mind, if I can't do those things I shouldn't even be doing the job, period.  I totally understand your point of view but there is just a very hard to break mindset for a lot of people that we are robots working the minimum we possibly can for your tip.  I can acknowledge that yes, I do earn my livelihood from your tip, but I still really want to do anything I can to *earn* your tip and won't feel satisfied if you are displeased in any way.  I know this is a wall of text but I'm drunk and just want you to know that there are many many different factors set a long time ago that cause things to be the way they are here and some of us are really trying hard within those parameters to care.","NO"

"Florida and many other colleges are in bad positions because a lot of the buildings on campus have federal protection as nationally registered historic sites. That eliminates a lot of land near The Swamp and would force them to build probably near the museum and softball fields. A lot of athletes live near there now but my understanding is that they are mostly non football/basketball. It's much more important to be near practice and eating facilities than have brand new condo living.

The Oregons of the world are going to make it that though and it further severs the tie between student and athlete. Many other kids on campus are living in dorms built nearly a century ago and I completely believe it is part of the campus experience. U
Understanding that people have been studying in those exact rooms for almost one hundred years can be a great perspective. Yeah it sucks not having AC in some dorms but there is a trade off between modern and traditional and I don't think you want to get caught too far on either side.","NO"
"I'd say go to [bogleheads.org](https://bogleheads.org) and start from there. If you prefer to read books, start from something easy like ""How a Second Grader Beats Wall Street"" (Allan Roth), or a small booklet (found for free online) called ""If you can"" (William Bernstein) which has a few sections and a recommended list of reading at each section (about 10 books in total), which cover everything from ""you need to start by saving money if you want to invest in the stock market"" to ""don't do crazy gambles, or you'll lose everything"" with historical accounts of early bubbles (all the way to the 17th century and with a book focused in the 1929 crash aftermath.

Invest regularly in index-tracking mutual funds (or Exchange Traded Funds) which have very low costs and try to do nothing fancy but just follow the S&amp;P 500 or some other index of choice. Will you become millionaire overnight? No, but your money won't also go to zero because your hedge fund manager made some crazy bet. An index-tracking fund tracking the the S&amp;P 500 has an historic average gain of 7% a year. Since the fund has costs, you're going to see a 6.95% or so gain per year. Do not panic when the market comes down, just think of it as a sale and as you being able to buy more for the same money. Over the long term (but not necessarily over the short term) the market will go up at the average of 7% so you'll gain. Since the short term has more volatility, don't put money in the stock market if you need it for the next 5-10 years (e.g. planning to buy a car or a house or invest in a business, or ...). You never know when the next market crash will come and finding that the money you need next week has been cut by 1/3 is not a great surprise. However, if you are planning to keep it stashed for the long term (e.g. some retirement funds) you can put it in the stock market.

Buy some bond funds as well so you don't see all your portfolio go down when the stock market crashes. If you have let's say 40% of your funds in bonds, when the market crashes you can sell some of those bonds to buy into the mutual funds above (at the sales price). The younger you are the lower the bond portion you can have (because even if you see your portfolio decrease in the short term, you have many years to recover before you retire). If you're 50 and you want to retire soon in 10-15 years, don't go with 80% in stocks or you risk not having enough to eat at the end of the month.

There has been a recent move towards commission-free brokers (Charles Schwab, a good one, just said that from now on they will charge nothing, whereas before they charges $4.95 per operation) so information is changing as we speak and what was good last week is not necessarily so this week. So, while Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade and a few others are probably good options, the list may change. In any case, if you go with passive funds, there's no point on going to a big broker house (like JP Morgan) which will be more expensive but offer services you probably won't need.

If you want to actively choose stocks you can, but this is a much harder venture (if you want to make money) as you'll have to thoroughly analyze companies and read annual reports to be able to keep an actual eye on your investments.","NO"

"&gt;Indian is the preferred term.

No. No it is not, I don't buy it. You may be right about them checking the census, but my entire point about the TV comment is that it's so widespread and acceptable because *people keep hearing it and not the alternative.* Of course they'll think it's *still* the preferred term if people have no reason not to.

Canada *generally* antiquated the use, but there is still ""Status Indian"" alongside stuff like M√©tis, Inuit and stuff. The term Indian is generally seen as a slur, *because it is,* and because for centuries they were kidnapping native kids to ""beat the Indian out of"" them. Maybe it's more offensive here because Canada was still putting Indigenous kids in concentration camps 50 years after the Nazis fell, and also trafficking them for forced adoptions during ""The Swoop.""

Also you're mixing between legal, cultural, geographical and other terms while also being only half right about some. Inuit *is synonymous* with arctic natives, Alaska and Siberia are the odd ones out. It's fine and all for native individuals there to reject the nomenclature if they have their own, but expecting everyone to when it's basically synonymous is just gatekeeping. And as a Metis that's been told unironically *""You're not a M√©tis, you're a m√©tis""* I just want to mention how hilariously nonsense it is.","NO"
